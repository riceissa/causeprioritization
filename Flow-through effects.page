    >  Flow-through is not a concept that EA needs. We don't need to
    >  agree on utility functions or probability distributions to get
    >  together under a tent of 'cause neutrality', 'scope sensitivity',
    >  'thinking on the margins', and 'being willing to quantitatively
    >  evaluate impact per dollar and pick the highest-scoring option'.
    >  When that leads to different priorities and strategies, we should
    >  be able to admit that openly and sort the relevantly concerned
    >  people toward their real best options, and not make up stories
    >  about flow-through.
