# List all causes on front page?

Pro:

- Makes it clear what all the causes we are considering are
- Possible to add more explanation than is possible for the `a-cause` category page

Con:

- Redundant, since the `a-cause` category is the "master list"
- Clutters up the front page
- Makes every cause seem equally plausible, unclear how much cause neutrality we should start with (e.g. we haven't listed neutering stray cats, although this cause is popular relative to others on the list)
