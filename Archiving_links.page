In order to make the Cause Prioritization Wiki a useful resource
for many years into the future, it is extremely important that
the external resources it links to are also available, in addition
to whatever material that is on the wiki itself.

This page outlines some of the ways to ensure external resources 
are available.

# Remote caching

The Internet Archive, WebCitation, and Archive.is all have on-demand
remote caching. I like the Internet Archive best because it is the
most popular and most unlikely to just suddenly disappear, but one 
disadvantage of the Internet Archive is that it is very respectful of
robots.txt (which is a good thing for some people, but bad for people
who want to ensure certain links are always alive).

To save a page on the Internet Archive, just visit

```
http://web.archive.org/save/URL_TO_ARCHIVE
```

For instance, to archive the front page of the
CP Wiki itself, just visit

```
http://web.archive.org/save/http://causeprioritization.org
```

As for the other two, as well as for other services like Perma.cc, there
exist archive forms on their respective sites, so it isn't necessary to
visit special URLs. I'm actually not sure why the Internet Archive doesn't
do this.
