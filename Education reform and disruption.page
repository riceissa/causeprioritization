Roughly, there are two ways to approach this problem:

1. The top-down approach, where people advocate for policy reform.

2. The bottom-up approach, where we have special programs for gifted students, for instance, or make homeschooling/unschooling more attractive.

Also, simply getting people to do things that are more efficient for their time/effort. E.g. would encouraging students to seek more "uniqueness" than they otherwise seek be "better" than encouraging them to all conform to the same core curriculum? Is it really important for everyone to know math? ([Great Scientist â‰  Good at Math](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578398943650327184)). Could we simply encourage people to pursue what they're **awesome** at and just delegate what they're weak at?

For now, there's more information on the [Unschooling]() page.
