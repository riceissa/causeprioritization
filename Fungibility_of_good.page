**Fungibility of good** is a term coined by Holden Karnofsky in "[Broad Market Efficiency](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/)":

> Another reason one’s view of “broad market efficiency” matters is it represents one mechanism for what I sometimes term the “fungibility of good” – the idea that making progress on one problem often leads to progress on other problems. For example, reducing the burden of malaria may make it more likely (depending on the degree of broad market efficiency) that other philanthropists shift from addressing malaria to addressing other problems. Thus, even if cause X is more important than cause Y, making progress on cause Y may cause other philanthropists to reallocate their giving away from cause Y and toward cause X, and may thus have some value for cause X.

> The “fungibility of good” is one possible contributor to “regression to the mean” in philanthropic opportunities, and one possible justification for placing weight on tractability (what one can accomplish within a cause) and not just importance (the value of progress on a cause).

There seems to be little discussion of this concept (at least under this name). [There is one instance](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-charities-dont-differ-astronomically-in-cost-effectiveness/#Fungibility_of_good) though.
