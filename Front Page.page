# Welcome to the cause prioritization wiki!

This wiki aims to be a useful resource for information on [cause prioritization](Cause prioritization).
Look at the [categories](http://causeprioritization.org/_categories) for how this wiki is organized, or the list below for some of the causes being explored.
At the moment the goal is to collect resources related to cause prioritization on each of the causes (in particular, the [Importance, tractability, neglectedness]() of the causes) and to produce many [shallow investigations](Shallow investigation) on these causes.
[Goals of the wiki]() also has more information.

This wiki is [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization), where you can get a full copy of it (including all of the revision history).

Contact [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com/contact) for questions.

# A partial list of causes

Eventually, we hope this wiki will have information for some or all of these causes:

- [Cause prioritization]() itself
- [Life extension]()/anti-aging
- [Artificial intelligence]()
- [Basic Income]()
- [Poverty/Social Inequality]()
- [Depression]()
- [Borderline Personality Disorder]()
- [Drug policy]()/war on drugs
- [Large-scale social movements]()
- [Misallocation of Talent]()
- [Open science]()
- [Emotional Intelligence]()
- [Romance]()
- [Promoting effective altruism]()
- [Migration](); specifically, labor mobility
- [Quantified self]()/self-experimentation
- [Animal welfare]()

**Note**: All principal causes (i.e. like those listed above) will have the category "[a-cause](http://causeprioritization.org/_category/a-cause)".
(This is so that in the future, if the number of principal causes increases, these can all be found in one place, even if the list above is not updated.
See also the discussion [here](http://causeprioritization.org/@Front%20Page#list-all-causes-on-front-page).)

# If you want to contribute

[Contact me](http://issarice.com/contact) and I can give you an account on the wiki.
Alternatively, you can fork the [wikidata directory](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization) on GitHub, and send me a pull request.

If you're not sure where you can contribute, try searching for "[FIXME](http://causeprioritization.org/_search?patterns=FIXME&search=Search)" in the search bar.

This site is intended to be [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-site); cloning the git repository is a small way to help.
If you find any broken links, you can try to find the new location or find an archived version on the [Internet Archive](), [Archive.Today](http://archive.today/), or [WebCite](http://webcitation.org/archive) (for more remote caching services, see [gwern's list](http://www.gwern.net/Archiving%20URLs#remote-caching)).
If an external (i.e. not on `causeprioritization.org`) HTML page is referenced, please add in parentheses (within an HTML comment) links to archives like this:

```
[text](http://example.com)<!--(link_to_archive1)(link_to_archive2)-->
```

(This makes it simple to switch out the links in case they become broken.)

For other formats (e.g. PDF), I try to keep several copies to ensure future accessibility.
For publicly available documents, I will try to do something like `[text](link_to_original)<!--(link_to_my_copy)-->`.
For paywalled articles I unfortunately cannot do this.
