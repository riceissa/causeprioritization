# Welcome to the cause prioritization wiki!

This wiki aims to be a useful resource for information on [cause prioritization](Cause prioritization).
Look at the [categories](http://causeprioritization.org/_categories) for how this wiki is organized, or the list below for some of the causes being explored.
At the moment the goal is to collect resources on each of the causes and to produce many [shallow investigations](Shallow investigation) on these causes.

This wiki is [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization), where you can get a full copy of it (including all of the revision history).

Contact [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com/contact) for questions.

# A list of causes

Eventually, we hope this wiki will have information for some or all of these causes:

- [Cause prioritization]() itself
- [Artificial intelligence]()
- [Depression]()
- [Large-scale social movements]()
- [Romance]()
- [Promoting effective altruism]()
- [Migration](); specifically, labor mobility
- [Life extension]()/anti-aging
- [Quantified self]()/self-experimentation
- [Animal welfare]()

**Note**: All principal causes (i.e. like those listed above) will have the category "[a-cause](http://causeprioritization.org/_category/a-cause)".
(This is so that in the future, if the number of principal causes increases, these can all be found in one place, even if the list above is not updated.)
