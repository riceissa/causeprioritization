# Welcome to the cause prioritization wiki!

This wiki aims to be a useful resource for information on [cause prioritization](Cause prioritization).
Look at the [categories](http://causeprioritization.org/_categories) for some of the causes being explored.
At the moment the goal is to collect resources on each of the causes and to produce many [shallow investigations](Shallow investigation) on these causes.

This wiki is [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization), where you can get a full copy of it (including all of the revision history).

Contact [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com/contact) for questions.
