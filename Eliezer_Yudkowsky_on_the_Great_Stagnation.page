In scattered places Eliezer Yudkowsky has written about the [Great Stagnation]().

["Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics"](https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf):

> I am in fact such a true cynic and I suspect that social factors dilute average contributions around as fast as new researchers can be added. A less cynical hypothesis would be that earlier science is easier, and later science grows more difficult at roughly the same rate that scientific output scales with more researchers being added.

> When I think of the Great Stagnation I think of the FDA destroying drug development to the point where we have exploding obesity; the degradation of many sciences to the point where dieticians can't solve obesity; the fact that math papers from 1960 seem far more readable and friendly despite, or maybe because of, not having access to LaTeX; I think of university systems dying amid exploding student debt; I think of declining real median income in an environment of rising rents and healthcare costs and the aforesaid student debt; I think of barriers to entry and everyone suing everyone else and all the other forces that have driven innovation into bits because innovation in atoms is somehow a lot less profitable; I think of coal plants in the places where liquid fluoride thorium reactors should be; I think of slums that weren't still supposed to be there, and maybe wouldn't be there if things had improved for the bottom 20% in Western countries at the same rate they did between 1930 and 1970.
