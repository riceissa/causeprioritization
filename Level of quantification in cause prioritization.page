Katja Grace in "[Shallow Overview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzpq81arki89gd9/Cause%20Prioritization%20Shallow%20Overview.docx)" ([archive](http://exp.riceissa.com/pdf/Cause%20Prioritization%20Shallow%20Overview.pdf)) lists the level of quantification as one of "project parameters" for cause prioritization research (page 9):

> **Level of quantification:** quantification brings rigor,
> transparency, and the ability to talk about judgements. On the
> other hand, it often results in leaving out vague considerations,
> and considerations where one does not have a good conscious
> model, and can give a false appearance of accuracy. Systematic
> cause prioritization sets itself apart from more traditional
> methods of selecting causes in part through a certain level of
> quantification.  However among those practicing prioritization,
> there is some disagreement about how far one should go.
