Do we want a more general "look at the future / longterm effects" cause? Basic arg would look like (from [Draft: The Case for Cause Prioritization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PWLgBDlk2MxEuJvY5OeG4UpFgso0yvJVf9xrTJkHSQ/edit#):
> the near-term effects of our actions... are probably swamped by the long-term effects. This is because the great majority of people will probably live in the future, which is likely to be very long and very large. So even a modest effect on the welfare of future generations can easily dominate normal effects on existing people, at least according to an aggregative perspective.
Also would include Nick Beckstead's thesis [ON THE OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE OF SHAPING THE FAR FUTURE](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE).
