From a cause prioritization perspective, the important questions are:

- To what extent does charity evaluation lead to having a bigger impact on the world?

    - Based this, how should we decide how much effort to put into charity evaluation?

The main case study here would be GiveWell.

Other examples: [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/)

Charities may be able to increase their effectiveness by funding more projects like [Impact Purchase](http://impactpurchase.org/) (see Ben Kuhn's summary [here](http://www.benkuhn.net/impact-purchase)).
