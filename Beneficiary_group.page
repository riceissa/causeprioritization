One way to classify cause areas is by their **beneficiary group**, i.e. the group of entities the cause area helps.

In trying to find new cause areas, one might look for new beneficiary groups ("expanding the moral circle") or look for specific subgroups within existing groups (e.g. depressed people as a subgroup of present people).
