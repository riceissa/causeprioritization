|Name|Creator|Creation date|Notes|
|--------------|-------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
|National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE)|National Center for Charitable Statistics|1980s[^ntee]|This seems to be the standard classification in the United States. It is used by the IRS, GuideStar, and Charity Navigator (although Charity Navigator also has its own classification system).|
|Charity Navigator's Categories/Causes system[^cn]|Charity Navigator|2007?[^cn_archive]||
|Australia's charity subtypes[^aus]|Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission|||
|Charity Accounts Taxonomy|[Financial Reporting Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Reporting_Council)|2017 (last update)[^frc]|Under "500 -- Dimensions Content", there is a "Charities specific dimensions" heading, under which there is a "Charitable objectives" heading. This heading contains the following objectives: (1) prevention or relief of poverty; (2) advancement of education; (3) advancement of religion; (4) advancement of health or the saving of lives; (5) advancement of citizenship or community development; (6) advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science; (7) advancement of amateur sport; (8) advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity; (9) advancement of environmental protection or improvement; (10) relief of those in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage; (11) advancement of animal welfare; (12) promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown, or of the efficiency of the police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services; and (13) any other charitable services.|
|Philanthropy Classification System[^fc]|Foundation Center|2014||
|Grants Classification System|Foundation Center||Mentioned as a predecessor to the Philanthropy Classification System.[^fc]|
|Taxonomy of Philanthropy|Catalogue for Philanthropy|2005?[^taxonomy_of_phil]|George McCully has written an essay explaining some of the motivations behind this taxonomy (the part around "We first considered using the conventional National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities" is interesting).[^mccully]|
|Luke Muehlhauser's "four focus areas"[^luke]|Luke Muehlhauser|2013|The four focus areas are (1) poverty reduction, (2) meta effective altruism, (3) the long-term future, and (4) animal suffering. Muehlhauser also suggests "effective environmental altruism" as a fifth focus area. This classification seems to have become somewhat of the norm in the effective altruism movement.|
|GiveWell's categorization of large-scale philanthropy focus areas[^givewell]|GiveWell/[Open Philanthropy Project]()|2012|"In categorizing giving for both of these, we deliberately used categories tailored to our own interests (rather than trying to come up with a universally useful taxonomy)."[^givewell]|

# Motivation

The reason for looking at how philanthropic areas are classified is to get some inspiration for how cause areas on this wiki might be classified. I think none of the existing classifications are well-suited for dealing with novel cause areas like [AI safety]() or [moral advocacy](), but the best case could still be that we can add things on to an existing classification system.
