# Motivation

The reason for looking at how philanthropic areas are classified is to get some inspiration for how cause areas on this wiki might be classified. I think none of the existing classifications are well-suited for dealing with novel cause areas like [AI safety]() or [moral advocacy](), but the best case could still be that we can add things on to an existing classification system.
