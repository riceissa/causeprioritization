|National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE)|National Center for Charitable Statistics|1980s[^ntee]||
|Charity Navigator's Categories/Causes system[^cn]|Charity Navigator|2007?[^cn_archive]||
|Australia's charity subtypes[^aus]|Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission|||
|Philanthropy Classification System|Foundation Center|||
|George McCully's thing||||
|Luke Muehlhauser's "four focus areas"[^luke]|Luke Muehlhauser|2013|The four focus areas are (1) poverty reduction, (2) meta effective altruism, (3) the long-term future, and (4) animal suffering. Muehlhauser also suggests "effective environmental altruism" as a fifth focus area. This classification seems to have become somewhat of the norm in the effective altruism movement.|

# Motivation

The reason for looking at how philanthropic areas are classified is to get some inspiration for how cause areas on this wiki might be classified. I think none of the existing classifications are well-suited for dealing with novel cause areas like [AI safety]() or [moral advocacy](), but the best case could still be that we can add things on to an existing classification system.
