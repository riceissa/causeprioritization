Many personal experiences (as opposed to moral arguments or abstract moral principles) feed into value judgments.

For instance Brian Tomasik talks about how many suffering-focused altruists have settled on suffering reduction due to personal experiences with extreme suffering.[^interview][^experiencing]

Some questions are:

- What experiences are we "allowed to" feed into value judgments?
- How do we distinguish between "value drift" and learning more about the world?
