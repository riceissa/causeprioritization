Kass[^kass] argues (p 179) that once we have life extension, the number of years we choose to extend people's lives will become arbitrary: "The number of years chosen will have to be arbitrary, barring some revelation or discovery."

"The case for mortality".

Also Kass[^kass] (p 181):

> Should we wish to avoid spilling blood, or desire a clean
technological solution, we could require that our drink from the fountain
of youth be accompanied by the implantation into our midbrains of an
automatic self-destruction device, preset to go off at an unknown time
some eighty to one hundred years hence. The control of natural decay
might intensify the fear of violent death.

(This quote seems ludicrous, but Kass seems serious...)
