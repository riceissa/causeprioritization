**Population ethics** (also sometimes more specifically **population axiology**) is ...

The causes one prioritizes is highly dependent on one's values, and in particular on one's views on population ethics.
Instead of trying to argue strongly for one position or another on population ethics, it's probably best to adopt a more "probabilistic" approach of value pluralism and "moral curve-fitting" by considering many different views and weighing them accordingly.
This does mean more work when prioritizing causes, but the result is more likely to be useful to a wider audience.
