It's unclear whether improving science as a whole would be positive from an [differential progress perspective](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/differential-progress/) as some scientific development could bring dangerous technologies before our social structure is able to deal with them.

However, the development of some sciences, like cognitive sciences, might be net positive. A project aiming to speed up the development of social sciences is the [Social Science Prediction Platform](https://socialscienceprediction.org/).
