- How importance is the cause?

    - What is the raw dollar estimate for solving the problems related to the cause?
    - More overall: factoring in all the other points, how important is the cause?  Should people work on it?

- How neglected/crowded is the cause?

    - How known is the cause?
    - How many people are working on it professionally (academia, industry, non-profits)?
    - Is the number of people working on it more/less than comparable causes?
    - Should more people be working on the cause?

- How tractable is the cause?

    - Is it something we can solve by throwing more money/people at it?
    - Is it something that may be impossible to solve?

- What are the ways people can help to solve the problems of the cause?

    - Can people just donate money?
    - Can people volunteer, and if so, how useful is this relative to other causes?
    - Is it an intellectually difficult problem (e.g. artificial intelligence, curing aging), or is it something that needs more advocacy (e.g. open borders)?  (It could be both.)
