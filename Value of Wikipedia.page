- [How Much is Wikipedia Worth?](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-much-is-wikipedia-worth-704865/?no-ist) and [Wikipediaâ€™s Economic Value](http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/band-gerafi10032013.pdf)

High level strategies for computing the value of Wikipedia:

- Find the total "value of the internet" and multiply by the fraction that
  Wikipedia can claim
- Replacement cost if Wikipedia disappeared
- Using some guess like "each pageview has a value of 1 or 2 cents" and then
  multiplying by how many pageviews Wikipedia gets
- The total cost of running the Wikimedia Foundation as an absolute lower bound

Some quick calculations:

According to [Akamai's real time web metrics](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/intelligent-platform/visualizing-akamai/real-time-web-metrics.jsp),
there are something like 77--79 million pageviews per minute, which translates
to 111--114 billion pageviews per day.

Wikipedia's pageviews are available in a [large table](https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesPageViewsMonthlyCombined.htm).
In 2016, there was around 16,000 million pageviews per 30 days, so around
533 million pageviews per day.

Combining the two, Wikipedia is about 0.5% of total pageviews on the Internet.
