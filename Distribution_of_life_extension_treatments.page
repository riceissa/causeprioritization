title: Distribution of life extension treatments

categories: life-extension

Questions:

- Historically, how have new biomedical treatments been distributed? 
    - What was the delay for e.g. the poor, less developed countries in receiving treatment?
    - What does the distribution currently look like for treatments that have been around for a while?
    - What is the distribution like as a function of e.g. the cost, the importance (how life-threatening is it?) of the treatment?

- Given the answers to the above, what can we say about the distribution of life extension treatments?
- Could the availability of treatment lead to violence or social instability?
For instance de Grey^["[Escape Velocity: Why the Prospect of Extreme Human Life Extension Matters Now](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC423155/)".]:

    > Overpopulation, probably the most frequently cited drawback of
    > curing aging, could not result for many decades, but the same
    > cannot be said for breadth of access irrespective of ability to
    > pay: in a post-9/11 world, restricted availability of rejuvenation
    > therapies resembling that seen today with AIDS drugs would invite
    > violence on a scale that, shall we say, might be worth trying to
    > avoid.
