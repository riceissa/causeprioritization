An existential risk is one that threatens the entire future of humanity. More specifically, existential risks are those that threaten the extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development.

# Types

Nick Bostrom classifies existential risks in the following categories^[[Existential Risks](https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)]:

> **Bangs** – Earth-originating intelligent life goes extinct in a relatively sudden disaster resulting from either an accident or a deliberate act of destruction.  
> **Crunches** – The potential of humankind to develop into posthumanity[7] is permanently thwarted although human life continues in some form.  
> **Shrieks** – Some form of posthumanity is attained but it is an extremely narrow band of what is possible and desirable.  
> **Whimpers** – A posthuman civilization arises but evolves in a direction that leads gradually but irrevocably to either the complete disappearance of the things we value or to a state where those things are realized to only a minuscule degree of what could have been achieved.

Anthropogenic risks are those that would be the result of human activity, and natural risks are those that would be caused by nature. There could also be risks from alien civilizations.

# List of existential risks

## By causes

Anthropogenic risks can be further categorized by whether they are intentional or accidental, and looking at the associated economic incentives.

Technological x-risks:

- [AI safety]() (related: [Whole brain emulation]())
- [Biosecurity]()
- [Climate change]()
- [Nuclear security]()
- [Physical disasters]()
- Other: [Emerging technologies assessment]()

Other anthropogenic x-risks:

- [Population control]()
- [Preventing totalitarianism]()
- [Wars](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/04/stock-vs-flow-war.html)

Natural x-risks:

- [Asteroids]()
- [Geomagnetic storms]()

Other:

- [Aliens]()
- Simulation shutdown (see: [Simulation hypothesis]())

## By mechanism
Bangs:

- [Nanotechnology]()
- Nuclear holocaust (see: [Nuclear security]())
- Simulation shutdown (see: [Simulation hypothesis]())
- Badly programmed superintelligence (see: [AI safety]())
- Bioengineered pandemics (see: [Biosecurity]())
- [Physical disasters]()
- Naturally occuring pandemics (see: [Biosecurity]())
- [Asteroid or comet impact]()
- Runaway global warming (see [Climate change](https://causeprioritization.org/Climate_change))

Crunches:

- Resource depletion or ecological destruction (see [Environmentalism]())
- Misguided world government or another static social equilibrium stops technological progress (see [Preventing totalitarianism]())
- “Dysgenic” pressures
- [Technological arrest]()

Shrieks:

- Take-over by a transcending upload (see [Whole brain emulation]())
- Flawed superintelligence (see [AI safety]())
- Repressive totalitarian global regime (see [Preventing totalitarianism]())

Whimpers:

- Our potential or even our core values are eroded by evolutionary development (see [Population control]())
- Killed by an extraterrestrial civilization (see [Aliens]())

## By type of risk^[[How to Understand and Mitigate Risk](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eA9a5fpi6vAmyyp74/how-to-understand-and-mitigate-risk)]

Transparent risks

Opaque risks

Knightian risks:

- Black swans
