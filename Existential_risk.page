An existential risk is one that threatens the entire future of humanity. More specifically, existential risks are those that threaten the extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development.

Anthropogenic risks are those that would be the result of human activity, and natural risks are those that would be caused by nature. There could also be risks from alien civilizations.

The Open Philanthropy Project with Good Venture is one of the main founders in this space as can be seen in their [grant database](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants).
