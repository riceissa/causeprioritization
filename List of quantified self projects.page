| App and physical tracking device. Health.
| Tracks various sleep metrics and heart rate. Seems to be geared toward people who exercise often. The app seems to even support goal-setting: <blockquote>Choose over 12 habits for activity, caloric burn, better sleep and more<br />Let Peak adjust your weekly goals based on your performance<br />Get notifications when youâ€™re on track or need a nudge</blockquote>

| Physical device, app. Health.
| As for metrics tracked, they list "steps, floors climbed, active minutes, calories burned and more"<ref>http://www.fitbit.com/app</ref>. From a brief look, there didn't seem to be any feature for goal-setting, although there are graphs that the app plots.
