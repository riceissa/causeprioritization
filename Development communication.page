The [BBC paper](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/research/working_paper_reframing_the_evidence_debates.pdf) argues that "compelling evidence of impact does exist and is being used" (pg 3) but that more evidence is needed.

    > The social change which media for development aims to make is more
    > incremental, less tangible and often not fixed (it evolves as
    > people's needs evolve). Indicators of success, and impact, are
    > seen by practitioners and evaluators alike to be harder to
    > measure; the challenges of attribution and contribution in
    > contexts where there are multiple complex influencing factors are
    > also trickier.
