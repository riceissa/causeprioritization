Media for development is significant and has attracted attention in itself, but it also provides insight into [Content creation]() more generally.

The [BBC paper](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/research/working_paper_reframing_the_evidence_debates.pdf) argues that "compelling evidence of impact does exist and is being used" (pg 3) but that more evidence is needed.
But what are examples of this "compelling evidence"?
It seems to be in [Appendix 2 of another PDF](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/research/appendices_reframing_the_evidence_working_paper.pdf).

    > The challenge therefore is that, while practitioners and
    > increasingly donors might "know" that media and communication
    > matters for development, this is at times an implicit, patchily
    > evidenced assumption that has to compete in crude terms with more
    > readily measurable development outcomes.

    (This probably applies more generally to content creation as well.)
