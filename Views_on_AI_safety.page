The people who seem most knowledgeable about AI safety still seem to disagree about many things *within* AI safety. It seems worth collecting some of these views into a single place.

- [Carl Shulman's views on AI safety]()
- [Dario Amodei's views on AI safety]()
- [Eliezer Yudkowsky's views on AI safety]()
- [Paul Christiano's views on AI safety]()
- [Robin Hanson's views on AI safety]()
- [Wei Dai's views on AI safety]()
- Daniel Dewey's views on AI safety
- Holden Karnofsky's views on AI safety
- Katja Grace's views on AI safety
- Owen Cotton-Barratt's views on AI safety
- Andrew Critch's views on AI safety

Here's the master list of topics I want to cover:

|Topic|Details|
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|AI timelines||
|Value of decision theory work||
|Value of highly reliable agent design work||
|Difficulty of AI alignment||
|Shape of takeoff/discontinuities in progress||
|Type of AI safety work most endorsed||
|How "prosaic" AI will be||
|Kind of AGI we will have first (de novo, neuromorphic, WBE, etc.)||
|Difficulty of philosophy||
|How well we need to understand philosophy before building AGI||

In addition, there are some discussion threads (on LessWrong and some other places) where some of these people go into long debates. Collecting some of these also seems like a good idea:
