The people who seem most knowledgeable about AI safety still seem to disagree about many things *within* AI safety. It seems worth collecting some of these views into a single place.

- [Carl Shulman's views on AI safety]()
- [Dario Amodei's views on AI safety]()
- [Eliezer Yudkowsky's views on AI safety]()
- [Paul Christiano's views on AI safety]()
- [Robin Hanson's views on AI safety]()
- [Wei Dai's views on AI safety]()

In addition, there are some discussion threads (on LessWrong and some other places) where some of these people go into long debates. Collecting some of these also seems like a good idea:
