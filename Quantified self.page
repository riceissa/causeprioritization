FIXME: explain what this cause is all about.
Is it even a valid EA cause?

If people are open about it (e.g. post rescuetime logs online), maybe it could inspire other people to pursue more productive paths. For people of extremely high intelligence/ability, time is the most important resource that there is. 

Having a "pool" of websites the smart visit most often could be really useful. 

Also, it can be used as a "big data" metric to monitor which environmental perturbations affect productivity so one can run self-experiments to ultimately determine what optimizes for productivity. People often don't know if X is a good investment of their time, so if you can show that putting X hours resulted in Y, then it could convince them that putting in X hours to Y is a viable option (or alternatively, that if they need > X hours for Y, then maybe they don't have a comparative advantage for Y and their talents may be better put somewhere else).
