**Quantified self** (also **lifelogging** or just **QS**) is the process of systematically collecting and
analyzing data about oneself in order to improve one's life. In other words,
it is self-improvement through self-knowledge through self-tracking and self-experimentation.

Quantified self isn't usually discussed in the context of an effective altruism cause,
but the basic idea fits under one of self-improvement along with others in this broad
category like [Lifestyle improvements](), improving rationality, and so forth.

In terms of a cause, quantified self has several approaches:

- Increasing awareness of quantified self, and getting more people to record various
  aspects of their life so they can improve on those aspects.
- Improving data collection tools so that self-tracking is easier or so that more
  aspects of one's life can be logged and analyzed.
- Improving data analysis tools so that collected data can more easily be visualized,
  or so that a broader synthesis of the data is possible (e.g. through machine
  learning).


# Importance

Some potential arguments in favor of focusing on quantified self:

- If people are open about it (e.g. post rescuetime logs online), maybe it could inspire other people to pursue more productive paths. For people of extremely high intelligence/ability, time is the most important resource that there is. 

- Having a "pool" of websites the smart visit most often could be really useful. 

- Also, it can be used as a "big data" metric to monitor which environmental perturbations affect productivity so one can run self-experiments to ultimately determine what optimizes for productivity. People often don't know if X is a good investment of their time, so if you can show that putting X hours resulted in Y, then it could convince them that putting in X hours to Y is a viable option (or alternatively, that if they need > X hours for Y, then maybe they don't have a comparative advantage for Y and their talents may be better put somewhere else).

- People aren't always at their most alert. QS can help people better identify which habits of activity lead to them being in maximum state of alertness for the greatest period of time. This is especially relevant for maximizing the productivity of the most highly-productive (10X) people.

Rudimentary self-tracking is already possible
