**Quantified self** (also **lifelogging** or just **QS**) is the process of systematically collecting and
analyzing data about oneself in order to improve one's life. In other words,
it is self-improvement through self-knowledge through self-tracking and self-experimentation.

Quantified self is not usually discussed in the context of effective altruism, but the basic idea falls under the umbrella of self-improvement (which encompasses ideas such as [Lifestyle improvements](), improving rationality, etc.).

In terms of a cause, quantified self has several approaches:

- Increasing awareness of quantified self and getting more people to record various
  aspects of their life for the purpose of self-improvement.
- Improving data collection tools so that self-tracking and self-analysis is easier and encompasses more aspects of one's life.
- Improving data analysis tools so that collected data can more easily be visualized
  or so that a broader synthesis of the data is possible (e.g. through machine
  learning).


# Importance

The arguments for the importance of the quantified self (QS) can be most generally divided into two categories: first, arguments which focus on benefits to the person quantifying themselves, and second, arguments which focus on ways in which people other than said person benefit from accessing that data. The second category can be perhaps more succinctly phrased as 'benefits arising from open access to QS data'.

Arguments in the first category:

- A person's level of alertness experiences natural variation throughout each day. QS combined with statistical analysis would facilitate the identification of habits that maximize or otherwise optimize the duration and periods of time when they are most alert. The same applies to "environmental perturbations" that affect productivity. (The importance of this increases commensurately with the productivity of any given person.)

- Quantifying the returns on time spent on various tasks would allow people to more easily identify areas in which they have or do not have a comparative advantage, allowing them to better optimize usage of their time.

- Possible entertainment from tracking and visualization. As [Bryan Caplan says,](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/the_unsung.html) "People may be misled by entertainment that falsely purports to be factual.  But they're not mistaken about how entertained they are.".

Arguments in the second category:

- Being able to correlate website browsing data with IQ has many potential applications. In particular, knowledge of which websites highly intelligent or highly accomplished people visit on a frequent basis could be of significant interest and value.

- Openness about productivity (e.g. if people posted RescueTime logs online) could inspire people to pursue more productive paths or weigh productivity (in a general sense) more in their decisions of what paths to pursue. For people of extremely high intelligence and ability, time is the most important and crucial resource available to them, so inspiring them to focus on productivity could benefit both themselves and the population as a whole.


# Tractability

Rudimentary self-tracking is already possible. Because QS has various approaches
to it (popularizing it, developing software and hardware to make it easier or
more insightful), tractability of QS depends on which approach we are
considering. In addition, tractability in each approach also depends on which
metric we are considering.  For instance, when popularizing QS, it's probably
easier to get people to start tracking their computer use through e.g. RescueTime
(since this is automatic) than it is to get people to manually record their
eating habits.
