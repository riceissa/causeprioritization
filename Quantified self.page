FIXME: explain what this cause is all about.
Is it even a valid EA cause?

If people are open about it (e.g. post rescuetime logs online), maybe it could inspire other people to pursue more productive paths. For people of extremely high intelligence/ability, time is the most important resource that there is. 

Also, it can be used as a "big data" metric to monitor which environmental perturbations affect productivity so one can run self-experiments to ultimately determine what optimizes for productivity
