[^offset]: I like this quote from the comment:

    > Cash transfers significantly relieve poverty of humans who are
    > alive today, and are fairly efficient at doing that. They are far
    > less efficient at helping or harming non-human animals or
    > increasing or reducing existential risk. Even if they have some
    > negative effect here or there (more meat-eating, or habitat
    > destruction, or carbon emissions) the cost of producing a
    > comparable benefit to offset it in that dimension will be small
    > compared to the cash transfer. E.g. an allocation of 90%
    > GiveDirectly, and 10% to offset charities (carbon reduction, meat
    > reduction, nuclear arms control, whatever) will wind up positive
    > on multiple metrics.
