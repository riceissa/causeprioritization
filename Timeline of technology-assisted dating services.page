| ''New York Review of Books'' personals column
| Slater writes: <blockquote>Classifieds made a comeback in America in the 1960s
and 1970s, encouraged by the era’s inclination toward individualism and
social exhibitionism. “Everybody was letting it all hang out in other
ways,” said Raymond Shapiro, a business manager for the New York Review
of Books, “so suddenly it was okay to display oneself in print. It was
very important to be ‘self-aware.’ So you’d get ads like: ‘Astrologer,
27, psychology student, desires to establish non-superficial friendship
with sensitive, choicelessly aware persons who are non-self-oriented,
deep, and wish to unearth real, personness relationships.’ ”<ref
