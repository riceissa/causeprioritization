In considering the ethics of aging, there is the problem of whether it is more important to bring more people into this world, or to keep older people alive.
Some considerations:

- Older people may have a lower quality of life compared to people who are yet to be born (and in general younger people) due to disease from old age.
- It may take less resources to keep older people alive than to raise new people to adulthood, but it may take less resources to simply bring new people into the world than to keep older people alive for a certain amount of time.
- Older people may be more valuable because of their historical/cultural knowledge (i.e. they are, in a sense, "walking history books").
