The idea of "broad market efficiency" has been introduced in [a post](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/) by GiveWell's Holden Karnofsky.

Some other pieces that discuss broad market efficiency in the non-profit world:

- "[It's harder to favor a specific cause in more efficient charitable markets](http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/its-harder-to-favor-specific-cause-in.html)"  by Carl Shulman
- A section on market efficiency in Brian Tomasik's "[Why Charities Don't Differ Astronomically in Cost-Effectiveness](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-charities-dont-differ-astronomically-in-cost-effectiveness/#Engineering_vs_market_efficiency)"
