**Values lock-in** refers to a possible future scenario in which a specific value system is locked in and changing it becomes impossible (or very difficult?). An alternative to values lock-in would be a scenario in which [philosophical progress]() is possible despite the existence of superhuman AI, because the values programmed into the AI involve consultation with humans, or are specified indirectly (e.g. "what we would want if we were better and knew more and so forth").
