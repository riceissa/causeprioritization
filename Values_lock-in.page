**Values lock-in** refers to a possible future scenario in which a specific value system is locked in and changing it becomes impossible (or very difficult?). An alternative to values lock-in would be a scenario in which [philosophical progress]() is possible despite the existence of superhuman AI, because the values programmed into the AI involve consultation with humans.
