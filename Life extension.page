**Life extension**, broadly defined, is the cause that works to further advances in biomedical treatments, specifically those related to aging.
Below, we outline the [Importance, tractability, and neglectedness]() of life extension, in line with our [General questions for causes]().

Anti-aging may be more relevant, as it incorporates the decrease in healthspan seen in age that's relevant for reasons beyond life/longevity extension (e.g. [Fluid intelligence decline with age]())

# Importance

Do we want to lose someone like Elon Musk or Edward O. Wilson?

For raw estimates of impact, see [Importance of life extension]().

## Objections and counter-objections

Given that a variety of criticisms have been put forth against life extension, it is important consider whether life extension is even a cause with positive outcomes.
A variety of counter-objections, also known as [Keyhole solutions](Keyhole solution), are also explored; this is especially important because preventing life extension may be impossible.
These issues are explored in the following:

- [Life extension and overpopulation]() considers the argument that if people stop dying, the world will become overpopulated, leading to some sort of disaster.
- [Life extension and stagnation]() considers the argument that if old people don't die, they will stay in power, be a majority, stop human evolution, etc., so that society will become stagnant.
- [Distribution of life extension treatments]() considers the argument that when life extension treatments become available, they will only be affordable for the rich, leading to e.g. ethical problems.
- [Arguments against life extension]()
