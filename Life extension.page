**Life extension**, broadly defined, is the cause that works to further advances in biomedical treatments, specifically those related to aging.
Below, we outline the [Importance, tractability, and neglectedness]() of life extension, in line with our [General questions for causes]().

Anti-aging may be more relevant, as it incorporates the decrease in healthspan seen in age that's relevant for reasons beyond life/longevity extension (e.g. [Fluid intelligence decline with age]())

# Importance

Do we want to lose someone like Elon Musk or Edward O. Wilson?

For raw estimates of impact, see [Importance of life extension]().

Given that a variety of criticisms have been put forth against life extension, it is important consider whether life extension is even a cause with positive outcomes.
This issue is explored in the following:

- [Life extension and overpopulation]() considers the argument that if people stop dying, the world will become overpopulated, leading to some sort of disaster.
- [Life extension and stagnation]() considers the argument that if old people don't die, they will stay in power, be a majority, stop human evolution, etc., so that society will become stagnant.
- [Distribution of life extension treatments]() considers the argument that when life extension treatments become available, they will only be affordable for the rich, leading to e.g. ethical problems.
- [Arguments against life extension]()

# Life extension and artificial intelligence

- There is the question of whether to try to achieve life extension directly (by doing research in it) or indirectly (in this case, by first working on creating a superintelligence which will then allow for life extension in humans).
For instance, it seems possible to claim something like the following: directly working to advance artificial intelligence is dangerous, so we should for the moment research AI safety per [differential intellectual progress](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Differential_intellectual_progress); at the same time, doing life extension research doesn't involve as much risk, so we should focus on that as well, and if we don't end up making much progress yet make progress on creating a friendly AI, then we might achieve life extension that way (in other words, one could argue that until friendly AI can be achieved one should directly focus on life extension research, but after that indirectly achieving it is more practical).
(This general argument can apply to other causes besides life extension as well.)
- [Diego Caleiro's comment](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/12p), where he notes in the context of differential intellectual progress that "if aging is cured, chronologically old individuals no longer would have an incentive to accelerate the intelligence explosion".
