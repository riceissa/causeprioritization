Anti-aging research fits under the broader category of biomedical research.
See for instance [this GiveWell post](http://blog.givewell.org/2014/01/15/returns-to-life-sciences-funding/).

Some places to begin looking:

- [Wikipedia's page on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension)

- [Aubrey de Grey](https://www.quora.com/Aubrey-de-Grey) on Quora, and SENS

- [Evan Gaensbauer's comment](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7m/open_thread/hs)

- [Fight Aging!](https://www.fightaging.org/), and other websites like it

- <http://senescence.info/>

- <http://www.vincegiuliano.name/Antiagingfirewalls.htm> and <http://www.anti-agingfirewalls.com/> (though these seem more about the science rather than the [Importance, tractability, neglectedness]() of fighting aging)

# Importance

## Importance/inevitability

> Age-related disorders are an established priority of medical
> research. Few would disagree with the elimination of individual
> age-related diseases (*e.g.*, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease) and
> with stopping and reversing individual age-related degenerative
> changes (*e.g.*, muscle loss, cognitive decline, visual
> impairment), so why oppose the elimination of all age-related
> diseases and degenerative changes? Furthermore, if developments
> allow for slowing aging by, say, 5%, no doubt efforts will be made
> to slow it by 10% and so on until aging can be stopped and
> reversed. The goal of biomedical research is to help people be as
> healthy as possible for as long as possible. This is an important
> point often overlooked: Ultimately, and whether we agree with it
> or not, biomedical research is progressing toward the development
> of a cure for human aging.

# Tractability

João Pedro de Magalhães' paper: [The Scientific Quest for Lasting Youth: Prospects for Curing Aging](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~aging/rr14_curing_aging_prospects.pdf)[^quora]:

> The failure (thus far) of the war on cancer exemplifies how, no
> matter how much money and human resources are invested into a
> complex medical problem, solving it often depends on the overall
> technological development. This is not surprising since,
> historically, science progresses in bursts driven by new ideas
> and particularly by new technologies, yet it has important
> implications for resource allocation, career choices, and
> marketing in context of life-extension research.

(page 464)

> Curing aging is unlikely to be achieved by a single intervention,
> but rather by a combination of therapies dealing with different
> facets of age-related degeneration, possibly developed over time,
> and that might require periodic application to maintain youth
> indefinitely. Therefore, the development and application of the
> necessary technologies can take much longer than anticipated.
> Nevertheless, there is no inherent reason for not being able to
> cure aging.
