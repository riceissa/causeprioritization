title: Veil of ignorance and functional decision theory

There is some connection between a "veil of ignorance"-based thinking and timeless/updateless/functional decision theory. It's not clear to me whether they are basically the same thing or not.

Demski:[^demski]

> Timeless decision theory / updateless decision theory / functional decision theory. Roughly, choosing a policy from behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. As I mentioned with accounting for base rates, it might seem from one perspective like this kind of reasoning is throwing information away; but actually, it is much more powerful. It allows you to set up arbitrary functions *from* information states *to* strategies. You are not actually throwing information away; you always have the option of responding to it as usual. You are *gaining* the option of ignoring it, or reacting to it in a different way, based on larger considerations.

In a post on the Open Phil blog, Holden Karnofsky talks about representing worldviews as agents, then says:[^karnofsky]

> We can further imagine deals that might be made behind a “veil of ignorance” (discussed previously). That is, if we can think of some deal that might have been made while there was little information about e.g. which charitable causes would turn out to be important, neglected, and tractable, then we might “enforce” that deal in setting the allocation. For example, take the hypothetical deal between the long-termist and near-termist worldviews discussed above. We might imagine that this deal had been struck before we knew anything about the major global catastrophic risks that exist, and we can now use the knowledge about global catastrophic risks that we have to “enforce” the deal - in other words, if risks are larger than might reasonably have been expected before we looked into the matter at all, then allocate more to long-termist buckets, and if they are smaller allocate more to near-termist buckets. This would amount to what we term a “fairness agreement” between agents representing the different worldviews: honoring a deal they would have made at some earlier/less knowledgeable point.

The "discussed previously" points to an earlier post.[^wv_div]

A post by Carl Shulman also mentions both the veil of ignorance and acausal decision theories (although not discussed together):[^shulman]

> However, from behind a veil of ignorance, before learning about the existence of large inaccessible populations, they might have preferred a deal in which their precepts would be followed in a case where great good could be done by their lights, e.g. an Adam and Eve scenario, in exchange for deferring to other concerns in worlds with big inaccessible populations.
