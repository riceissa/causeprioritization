There is some connection between a "veil of ignorance"-based thinking and timeless/updateless/functional decision theory.

Demski:[^demski]

> Timeless decision theory / updateless decision theory / functional decision theory. Roughly, choosing a policy from behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. As I mentioned with accounting for base rates, it might seem from one perspective like this kind of reasoning is throwing information away; but actually, it is much more powerful. It allows you to set up arbitrary functions *from* information states *to* strategies. You are not actually throwing information away; you always have the option of responding to it as usual. You are *gaining* the option of ignoring it, or reacting to it in a different way, based on larger considerations.
