**Life extension and stagnation** is the idea that, once the old generation continues to live due to life extension treatment, their old ideas/genes will continue to live too, leading to a lack of progress in culture, ideas, etc.

de Magalhaes[^senescenceinfo] says:

> Curing aging would mean the current human culture would be predominant because older persons would never retire, probably would hardly change their ideas, and would block the way to the younger, fresh ideologies. Culturally, or memetically, humankind has been evolving at an astonishing pace. If we compare human society 1,000 years ago with our society now we see an extraordinary cultural evolution in various concepts and even in ethics (e.g., slavery and racism were widely accepted not too long ago in human history). In [spite] of the fact that someone brilliant at his/her job would be able to continue at it forever, to have a generation of men and women without cultural progress could be a catastrophe for humankind.

A different take by Anne Corwin on "[Superlongevity, Stagnation, and Posthuman Potential](http://www.existenceiswonderful.com/2006/05/superlongevity-stagnation-and.html)"<!--(https://archive.today/FVUW9)-->, which argues that as people stop dying, "biological evolution" will stop, but cultural evolution will continue; i.e. evolution will "occur through creative means that are nonbiological in nature".
This is the opposite of de Magalhaes, who says that genetic evolution can continue through genetic engineering (see quote above), but that cultural progress may stop.
So what about the concern for stagnation cited by de Magalhaes?
Corwin argues that "It makes little sense to place arbitrary limits on the brains of posthumans in terms of the ability of these brains to enjoy a degree of plasticity and flexibility often considered the exclusive province of the young and new."
She even argues that people who live longer will be valuable for their greater experience and perspective:

> I imagine that if there were any humans alive today (with intact memories) who were born 500 or 1000 years ago, these people, far from being seen as evidence of "stagnation", would almost certainly be sought after for their ability to offer a long-range perspective.

This might be convincing if the people with extended lives were a minority, but de Magalhaes seems to concerned with a society where the majority of people have extended lives.

# Delayed maturity

A related argument is that slowing down aging will result in more years of "adolescence" for people.
This is articulated by for instance Kass[^kass]:

> Retardation of aging could really mean prolongation of functional immaturity.
Consider the young: isolated not only from the top of the ladders
of power but also from some of their lower rungs, supported by or even
living with parents into their thirties or beyond, kept in a protracted
sexually mature "adolescence," frustrated,isaffected, rebellious or
apathetic---the picture is not difficult tocomplete

# Counterarguments

One counterargument to stagnation from life extension is that life extension has to some extent been implemented already, and that stagnation certainly hasn't happened so far.
Infidel753 writes in "[The moral bankruptcy of deathism](http://infidel753.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-moral-bankruptcy-of-deathism.html)"<!--(https://archive.today/7FZi8)-->:

> Indeed, we're already quite some ways down this road.  During the 20th century, life expectancy at birth in developed countries roughly doubled, from about 40 years to about 80, due to vaccines, antibiotics, and various other innovations.  All the clichéd objections that are now made to radical life extension -- overpopulation, cultural stagnation due to having too many old people around, widening the gap between rich and poor countries, etc. -- could just as easily have been made in 1900 against these achievements.  But it would be an audacious deathist indeed who would argue today that we should not have invented vaccines, or should stop using them now.  The coming advances which will extend an individual's youthful life to centuries and eventually millennia are essentially a continuation and acceleration of the same trend.

Another argument is that it's unclear why older people have more ossified thinking.
Aubrey de Grey considers a few possibilities in "[Why we should do all we can to hasten the defeat of human aging](https://web.archive.org/web/20071009192434/http://www.sens.org/concerns.htm#stag)":

- Biological aging of the brain.
But if this is the case, then since part of the idea of life extension is to stop the aging of the brain as well, "those whose lives are extended by such technologies will not have old, decrepit brains, but rather youthful, innovative brains which have merely been in existence for a longer period of time and thus accumulated all the more experience to work with" ([Infidel753](http://infidel753.blogspot.com/2007/03/on-argument-from-stagnation.html)).
- Amount of information in the brain, or, as [Infidel753 says](http://infidel753.blogspot.com/2007/03/on-argument-from-stagnation.html) "the mere fact of having existed for a longer rather than a shorter time"
- Social pressures
- There is even the argument that people may not maintain a single identity if they live for a very long time.
Consider Rebecca Roache [discussing](https://aeon.co/essays/how-will-radical-life-extension-transform-punishment) punishment:

    > A lot of philosophers who have written about personal identity
    > wonder whether identity can be sustained over an extremely long
    > lifespan. Even if your body makes it to 1,000 years, the thinking
    > goes, that body is actually inhabited by a succession of persons
    > over time rather than a single continuous person. And so, if you
    > put someone in prison for a crime they committed at 40, they
    > might, strictly speaking, be an entirely different person at 940.
    > And that means you are effectively punishing one person for a
    > crime committed by someone else. Most of us would think that
    > unjust.

- There is also the keyhole solution of conditionally offering life extension treatment.
For instance, one could offer treatment conditional on relinquishing the right to vote, or agreeing not to hold government positions (e.g. supreme court justiceship).
