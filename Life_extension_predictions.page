A conference report published in 1976[^neugarten] states (pg iii):

[^neugarten]:
Bernice L. Neugarten and Robert J. Havighurst.
*Social Policy, Social Ethics, and the Aging Society*.
1976.
Preface, and their paper "Aging and the Future".
A report prepared for the National Science Foundation.

> There is also the possibility (in the minds of some gerontologists, the probability) that the human life span will be extended another 5 years by the year 2000.

They elaborate (pg 4):

> Thus far all the increases in life expectancy have been due to increased controls over disease and not, so far as is known, to any decrease in the rate of aging.
The question then becomes, Are there likely to be dramatic discovereis with regard to rate control that will lead to a mushrooming in numbers of older persons by the year 2000?
>
> In attempting to answer this question, the present authors have made inquiries of leading biological researchers, asking for their assessments.
With the striking exception of a few who are saying that if research efforts were generously enough supported, the life-span could be extended some 20 to 25 years [...] the responses we have thus far received are consistently negative.
[...]
We have therefore proceeded on the conservative view that there will be no dramatic changes in the length of the human life span within the next several decades [...]

Question: did this happen? i.e. did the human life span increase by 5 years from 1976 to 2000?
(also do they mean average life span or in absolute terms?)

Ethan: Are advocates for life extension way too optimistic?
