This is the **Manual of style** for the Cause Prioritization wiki. Feel
free to reference this page when you have questions about the editing
style. However, we also like to [Be Bold], so don't worry too much about
style if it makes you anxious.

Discuss the manual of style on the [corresponding discussion
page][discuss].

# General rule

In general, it's best to follow [Wikipedia's Manual of Style][wmos],
which is fairly comprehensive.  The exceptions that follow are mostly
due to this wiki using markdown and not MediaWiki for its source files.

# Exceptions

Here are some general points that diverge from Wikipedia's Manual of
Style.

- Text width should be around 72 characters long. (This is so it's easy
  to see changes when diffing between versions.)
- For links, use `[text][alias]` and then define `[alias]: url`
  somewhere else in the document (usually right after the first
  occurrence of the link).  This is so that the flow of text in the page
  source is not disrupted.
- Keywords for a page should include the phrases that someone looking
  for the topic would likely use to locate the page. In practice, these
  are best discovered "naturally" as one tries and fails to locate a
  page, then adds the keywords that one initially used (but didn't lead
  to the page).

    As for style, just use an HTML comment at the top of the page, right
    below the header, like this:

    ```
    <!-- keywords
    keyword1 keyword2 keyword3
    -->
    ```
- Although gitit can handle several different markup languages for the
  document source, use markdown.
- For referencing an external source, either document the citation in a
  footnote, or link to the source.
