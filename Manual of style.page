This is the **Manual of style** for the Cause Prioritization wiki. Feel
free to reference this page when you have questions about the editing
style. However, we also like to [Be Bold], so don't worry too much about
style if it makes you anxious.

page][discuss].

Some general points:

- Text width should be around 72 characters long. (This is so it's easy
  to see changes when diffing between versions.
- If you're not sure, use US English.
- For really short links, use `[text](url)`, but for links longer than ?
  characters, use `[text][alias]` and then define `[alias]: url`
  somewhere else in the document (usually right after the first
  occurrence of the link.
- Keywords for a page should include the phrases that someone looking
  for the topic would likely use to locate the page. In practice, these
  are best discovered "naturally" as one tries and fails to locate a
  page, then adds the keywords that one initially used (but didn't lead
  to the page).

    As for style, just use an HTML comment at the top of the page, right
    below the header, like this:

    ```
    <!-- keywords
    keyword1 keyword2 keyword3
    -->
    ```
