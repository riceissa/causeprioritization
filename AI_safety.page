[AI Impacts](http://www.aiimpacts.org/) is an informational site that "aims to improve our understanding of the likely impacts of human-level artificial intelligence".

The main EA organization working in this field seems to be [MIRI](http://intelligence.org/), which does relevant math research and sponsors forecasting projects like [AI Impacts](http://www.aiimpacts.org/).
FHI might also have more information.

[*Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199678111/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) by [Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/) lays out a foundation for navigating scenarios where machine brains surpass human brains in general intelligence.
