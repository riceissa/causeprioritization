All the repositories of content (Quora, Wikipedia, reddit, Facebook, Gmail) are imperfect and have glaring weaknesses. There could theoretically be a new UI design that makes sharing/remembering/locating/remixing/downloading information **much** easier. 

There needs to be a system to maximize signal to noise ratio while ALSO not discouraging people to contribute if they have potentially interesting ideas. Wikipedia has a good S/N ratio, but is now overrun by deletionists. Quora re-surfaces **good** content people have posted years ago, which is good, but people seem not as free to contribute as they would on reddit (especially microcontributions like posting individual links as answers)

Could there also be an alternative to vertical scrolling? (especially with virtual reality?)
