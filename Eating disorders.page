- [Secretly starving: inside the virtual world of anorexia](http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/inside-the-world-of-anorexia-blogging/) (lists some eating disorder charities):

    > Taken to the extreme, these innocuous-sounding “tips” could be not
    > only unhealthy - but dangerous. Eating disorders have the highest
    > mortality rate of any mental illness, with 20 per cent of
    > sufferers dying prematurely from the disease and associated
    > medical complications. Websites that promote anorexia and bulimia
    > as a lifestyle choice are feeding a mindset that can, ultimately,
    > be fatal.
