|AI timelines||
|Value of decision theory work|see [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ah5/singularity_summit_2011_workshop_report/5ycj). "For example I've mostly stopped working on decision theory because it seems to help UFAI as much as FAI." from [this comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ah5/singularity_summit_2011_workshop_report/5ya3)|
|Value of highly reliable agent design work||
|Difficulty of AI alignment||
|Shape of takeoff/discontinuities in progress||
|Type of AI safety work most endorsed|I think somewhere he talked about how working on intelligence amplification to solve philosophical problems is more promising. See e.g. [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e2k/cynical_explanations_of_fai_critics_including/7786), [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6mi/some_thoughts_on_singularity_strategies/ "Wei Dai (July 13, 2011). “Some Thoughts on Singularity Strategies”. LessWrong.").|
|How "prosaic" AI will be||
|Kind of AGI we will have first (de novo, neuromorphic, WBE, etc.)||
|Difficulty of philosophy|Philosophy is hard. Wei has discussed this in many places. See [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ig9/outside_views_and_miris_fai_endgame/9o19) for one discussion. See [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jgz/aalwa_ask_any_lesswronger_anything/dx46) for a recent comment. I'm not aware of a single comprehensive overview of his views on the difficulty of philosophy.|
|How well we need to understand philosophy before building AGI|We need to understand philosophy well. See some of the discussions with Paul Christiano.|
