This page is about creating better (more engaging, fun, safe, etc.) forms of **entertainment**. This is different from [Access to entertainment](), which considers replicating existing forms of entertainment so more people can have fun.

Questions:

- Is entertainment getting better? Both within a medium (e.g. are novels getting more entertaining?) and across media (e.g. are TV shows more entertaining than novels?).
