Aaron Swartz seems notable in having worked on [numerous projects](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/interruptdriven) throughout his lifetime. In addition, he has connections to many different groups, including [GiveWell](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/01/16/in-memory-of-aaron-swartz/), reddit, Creative Commons (and thus the free content movement), the Free Software Foundation (and thus the free software movement), the [Digital rights]() movement, [unschooling](https://web.archive.org/web/20010415015213/http://swartzfam.com/aaron/school/), and more. In other words, understanding how and why he chose the projects he worked on could provide insight into prioritizing causes.
