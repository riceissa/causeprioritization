The **Open Philanthropy Project** (often abbreviated as **Open Phil**[^vox_matthews] and formerly GiveWell Labs) is a joint project between GiveWell (a charity evaluator focusing mostly on global health) and Good Ventures (a philanthropic organization co-founded by Cari Tuna and her husband Dustin Moskovitz, one of the co-founders of Facebook)[^insidephilanthropy] that tries to identify the most effective ways to give money to a wide variety of causes.[^openphil_formerly_gwl] [^syd] The project identifies important and neglected problems and tries to fund tractable approaches to solve those problems. The project conducts analysis and data collection.[^bcg_pers]

# History

The Open Philanthropy Project started out as GiveWell Labs in 2011 but made little progress until 2013.<ref name="open_phil_progress">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/progress-to-date |title=Progress to Date |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/08/announcing-givewell-labs/ |title=Announcing GiveWell Labs |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref>

The name was changed to Open Philanthropy Project in August 2014<ref name="open_phil_progress"/> to separate it from GiveWell and also to avoid exclusive association to GiveWell since it is a collaboration with Good Ventures. However even after this initial brand change, updates to Open Phil were still posted to the GiveWell blog.[^openphil_formerly_gwl]

In April 2015, Open Phil announced a partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and Mike Krieger (co-founder of Instagram). Trigger and Krieger pledged $750,000 over two years while Open Phil would provide information and include Trigger in team meetings.[^vox_matthews]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/23/co-funding-partnership-with-kaitlyn-trigger-and-mike-krieger/ |title=Co-funding Partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and Mike Krieger |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell |first=Holden |last=Karnofsky}}</ref><ref name=glasspockets>{{cite web|url = http://blog.glasspockets.org/2015/08/on-a-quest-to-do-as-much-good-as-possible-with-giving-an-innovative-philanthropy-project-has-attracted-a-new-co-fundin.html|title = Glasspockets Find: Open Philanthropy Project Forms New Partnership with Instagram Co-Founder|date = August 13, 2015|accessdate = April 9, 2016|last = Moy|first = Melissa|publisher = Glasspockets}}</ref>

In September 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced on the GiveWell blog that it would launch a separate website for Open Phil by the end of 2015.<ref name="project_update_9_17">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/17/open-philanthropy-project-update/ |title=Open Philanthropy Project update |newspaper=GiveWell Blog |date=September 17, 2015 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref> By February 2016, updates to Open Phil were posted to the Open Phil blog rather than the GiveWell blog (as was previously done).<ref name="gw_blog_archive_2016_02">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2016/02/ |title=2016 February |newspaper=GiveWell Blog |date=February 2016 |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref>

As of March 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project is not an independent organization i.e. it is still a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, who share office space and information (to an extent). However Open Phil is in the process of becoming an independent organization.<ref name="about_page">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/good-ventures-and-givewell |title=Good Ventures &amp; GiveWell |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738 |first=Elie |last=Hassenfeld |title=Comment on December 2015 Open Thread}}</ref>

# Organizational structure

Cari Tuna is the organization's president, Holden Karnofsky is the executive director, and Elie Hassenfeld is the managing director. Open Phil also has several program officers for various focus areas (such as US policy and scientific research), research analysts, and other roles.<ref name="open_phil_team">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team |title=Team |accessdate=June 17, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

# Evaluation process

Investigation for the Open Philanthropy Project is considered more difficult than the traditional work done for GiveWell due to the great uncertainty and inherent difficulty of comparing wildly different causes.[^vox_matthews]

Open Phil divides its work into lower-depth investigations (also called shallow overviews), higher-depth investigations (including focus areas), and cross-cutting projects.<ref name="refining"/>

Open Phil also practices "giving to learn", i.e. a process of committing to causes to better learn about them.<ref name="refining"/><ref name="committing_to_causes">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/ |title=The Importance of Committing to Causes |newspaper=Blog.givewell.org |date=May 14, 2014 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c"/> Executive Director Holden Karnofksy has described Open Phil's approach as one of "hits-based giving", where they aim to have a portfolio of grants that maximizes the likelihood of a highly impactful grant.<ref name=hits>{{cite web|url = http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving|title = Hits-based Giving|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = April 4, 2016|accessdate = April 6, 2016|publisher = Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

## Shallow overviews

The Open Philanthropy Project publishes shallow overviews of general causes.<ref name=shallow>{{cite web|url=http://givewell.org/shallow/|title = Shallow investigations of new causes|publisher = GiveWell (as part of the Open Philanthropy Project)|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> The first shallow overview appears to have been published in April 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/shallow/migration|title = Seasonal migration within low-income countries|publisher = GiveWell|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2013-09-21}}</ref> but GiveWell appears to have first officially announced shallow overviews in a blog post in May 2013.<ref name="refining">{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/|title = Refining the Goals of GiveWell Labs|date = 2013-05-30|accessdate = 2013-09-21|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> As of September 2013, shallow investigations have been conducted in the areas of anthropogenic climate change, detection of near-Earth asteroids, migration (intra-country and international), volcanoes, geoengineering, nuclear security, business environment, infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, and the treatment of animals in industrial agriculture.<ref name=shallow/> GiveWell co-executive director Holden Karnofsky discussed more about the purpose of shallow overviews in a conversation with Giving What We Can representatives and other effective altruists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jefftk.com/p/flow-through-effects-conversation|title = Flow Through Effects Conversation|date = 2013-08-31|accessdate = 2013-09-21|last = Kaufman|first = Jeff}}</ref>

# Focus areas

The Open Philanthropy Project uses the term "cause" to describe a problem or opportunity that requires expertise in order to make good giving decisions. It uses the term "focus area" for causes with the highest level of priority.<ref name="focus_areas">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus |title=Focus Areas |accessdate=March 18, 2016 |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>

The following table lists the current (as of June 2016) focus areas for each broad category of investigation as well as program officers for each focus area or broad category.<ref name="open_phil_team"/><ref name="focus_areas"/><ref name="open_democracy_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/scott-weathers/can-effective-altruism-change-world-it-already-has |title=Can ‘effective altruism' change the world?

In a blog post in October 2015, Holden Karnofsky described reasons Open Phil isn't currently funding organizations that promote [[effective altruism]].<ref name="Effective-altruism.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pf/why_the_open_philanthropy_project_isnt_currently/ |title=Why the Open Philanthropy Project isn't currently funding organizations focused on promoting effective altruism |newspaper=Effective Altruism Forum |date=October 28, 2015 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

## Farm animal welfare

Open Phil is focusing on farm animal welfare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacy-reese/what-the-chan-zuckerberg_b_8704802.html |title=What the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Could Do for Animals |date=December 3, 2015 |first=Jacy |last=Reese |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref> In September 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced that the Open Philanthropy Project had hired Lewis Bollard as a program officer to work on farm animal welfare in industrial agriculture.<ref name="lewis_bollard_post">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/11/incoming-program-officer-lewis-bollard/ |title=Incoming Program Officer: Lewis Bollard |newspaper=Blog.givewell.org |date=September 11, 2015 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Animalcharityevaluators.org_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/how-to-conduct-studies-that-will-encourage-more-effective-altruists-to-care-about-animals/ |title=How to Conduct Studies That Will Encourage More Effective Altruists to Care about Animals |newspaper=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=January 20, 2016 |author= Kieran Greig |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2016, Open Phil announced grants of $1 million each to [[The Humane League]] and [[Mercy for Animals]] and $500,000 to [[The Humane Society of the United States]] for corporate cage-free campaigns.<ref name="open_phil_grants" /> Lewis Bollard, the program officer responsible for farm animal welfare, explained the rationale behind the grants in a blog post.<ref name=bollard-cage-free>{{cite web|url = http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/initial-grants-support-corporate-cage-free-reforms|title = Initial Grants to Support Corporate Cage Free Reforms|date = March 31, 2016|last = Bollard|first = Lewis|accessdate = April 6, 2016|publisher = Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref> [[Animal Charity Evaluators]] stated that this grant completely or nearly completely filled The Humane League's immediate [[room for more funding]], but that The Humane League could still grow in other areas that are not funded by the grant.<ref name="ace_thl_rfmf">{{cite web |url=https://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/update-on-thls-room-for-funding/ |title=Update on THL's Room for Funding |newspaper=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=March 18, 2016 |author= Allison Smith |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

## Criminal justice reform

Open Phil is investigating criminal justice reform due to poor conditions in prisons and bipartisan agreement in the US. There are difficulties to this investigation because of lack of [[randomized controlled trials]] of interventions.[^vox_matthews]

In June 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced that Open Phil had hired Chloe Cockburn (who was Advocacy and Policy Counsel for [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Campaign to End Mass Incarceration) as program officer for criminal justice reform.<ref name="chloe_hiring">{{cite web |url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/06/16/incoming-program-officer-for-criminal-justice-reform-chloe-cockburn/ |title=Incoming Program Officer for Criminal Justice Reform: Chloe Cockburn |newspaper=GiveWell Blog |date=June 16, 2015 |author=Holden Karnofsky |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

Discussing the decision to hire Cockburn as part of a larger overview of the Open Philanthropy Project, Sydney Martin, not affiliated with Open Phil, wrote: "Trying to organize the political will to take on something like reforming the US incarceration system was nearly impossible. Let alone trying to stand against those that have millions invested in keeping the prison industry alive and well. It always felt that these sorts of reforms was David vs. Goliath. But with a large sum of money, and a lot of thoughtful careful effort, change seems to have a tangible future."[^syd]

## Land use reform

Open Phil published a public report on land use reform in March 2015. As of March 2016, there are no full-time staff working in this area. Alexander Berger leads the grantmaking.<ref name="land_Openphilanthropy.org_March_21_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/land-use-reform |title=Land Use Reform |newspaper=Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref>

## Macroeconomic stabilization policy

In May 2014, Open Phil published a medium-depth report on macroeconomic policy.<ref name="macro_Openphilanthropyorg_March_21_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/macroeconomic-policy |title=Macroeconomic Policy |newspaper=Open Philanthropy Project |date=May 2014 |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref> As of March 2016, there are no full-time staff working in this area. Alexander Berger leads the grantmaking.<ref name="macro_main_Openphilanthropyorg_March_21_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/macroeconomic-policy |title=Macroeconomic Stabilization Policy |newspaper=Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate= March 21, 2016}}</ref>

## Immigration policy

Open Phil is investigating "labor mobility" or migration liberalization influenced by [[Michael Clemens]] and [[Lant Pritchett]]. This has mainly been because of potential wage increases for migrating workers (particularly low-skilled workers). Open Phil published a shallow overview of the cause in May 2013. By September 2013, labor mobility had become the subject of a "deep investigation".<ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://openborders.info/blog/overview-of-the-open-philanthropy-projects-work-on-migration-liberalisation/ |title=Overview of the Open Philanthropy Project's work on migration liberalisation |publisher = ''Open Borders: The Case'' |date=March 18, 2015 |first=Sebastian |last=Nickel |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2014, Open Phil awarded a grant of $1.2 million to the Center for Global Development. In July 2014, it awarded $1.5 million to the U.S. Association for International Migration and the International Organization for Migration, and $285,000 to ImmigrationWorks.<ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c"/>

Sebastian Nickel, writing in March 2015 and again in April 2016 for the pro-migration liberalization website *Open Borders: The Case* evaluated Open Phil's work on migration liberalization favorably.<ref name="Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c" /><ref name=nickel-open-phil-update>{{cite web|url = http://openborders.info/blog/update-open-philanthropy-projects-work-migration-liberalisation/|title = Update on the Open Philanthropy Project’s Work on Migration Liberalisation|last = Nickel|first = Sebastian|date = April 8, 2016|accessdate = April 9, 2016|publisher = ''Open Borders: The Case''}}</ref>

## Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence

In August 2015, Open Phil contributed $1.2 million to the [[Future of Life Institute]] (FLI) in the same wave of grants in which [[Elon Musk]] participated. The grant came as many including Musk and [[Stephen Hawking]] publicly expressed the need for [[AI safety]] research.<ref name="Betaboston.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/07/01/boston-group-awards-10m-from-elon-musk-to-jump-start-artificial-intelligence-research/ |title=Boston group awards $6m from Elon Musk to jump-start artificial intelligence research |newspaper=Beta Boston |date=July 1, 2015 |author=Elizabeth Preston |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Bloomberg.com_March_20_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/musk-backed-group-probes-risks-behind-artificial-intelligence |title=Musk-Backed Group Probes Risks Behind Artificial Intelligence |newspaper=Bloomberg Business |date=July 1, 2015 |author=Jack Clark |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="fortune_musk"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk/FutureOfLifeRFP |title=Future of Life Institute grant |date=August 2015 |accessdate=March 21, 2016 |publisher=GiveWell}}</ref>

## Biosecurity

Open Phil published a shallow investigation of biosecurity in January 2014, which covered natural pandemics, bioterrorism, and dual use research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/biosecurity |title=Biosecurity |date=January 2014}}</ref>

In February 2017, Open Phil announced a grant of $16 million over three years to the [[Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security]]. This was Open Phil's largest grant to date in this focus area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/biosecurity/center-health-security-biosecurity-global-health-security-and-global-catastrophic |title=Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — Biosecurity, Global Health Security, and Global Catastrophic Risks |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |quote=We decided to write about this grant as it is our largest grant to date in the area of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness.}}</ref>

# Grants made

The Open Philanthropy Project has given grants to a variety of organizations, including the Future of Life Institute for research into potential dangers of artificial intelligence<ref name="fortune_musk">{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/01/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence/ |title=Why Elon Musk is donating millions to make artificial intelligence safer |first=Jonathan |last=Vanian |date=July 1, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |publisher=''Fortune''}}</ref> and the Center for Global Development.<ref name="inside_phil_cgd">{{cite web |url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/3/9/leverage-why-this-silicon-valley-funder-is-doubling-down-on.html |title=Leverage: Why This Silicon Valley Funder Is Doubling Down on a Beltway Think Tank |publisher=Inside Philanthropy |date=March 9, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>

(A comparable figure for last year would have been under $20 million.)}}</ref> though when the post was published only $46 million worth of grants awarded during 2016 had been made public. In August 2016, Open Phil retroactively added to their grants database grants that Good Ventures made for GiveWell-recommended charities;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-and-development/miscellaneous/schistosomiasis-control-initiative-general-support |title=Schistosomiasis Control Initiative — General Support |publisher=Open Philanthropy Project |accessdate=August 31, 2016 |date=August 2016 |quote=This page was created using content published by Good Ventures and GiveWell, the organizations that created the Open Philanthropy Project, before this website was launched. Uses of “we” and “our” on this page may therefore refer to Good Ventures or GiveWell, but they still represent the work of the Open Philanthropy Project.}}</ref> these are excluded from the following tables, but are listed separately at [[Good Ventures#Grants to GiveWell-recommended charities|Good Ventures § Grants to GiveWell-recommended charities]].

The following is a summary of the grants based on year.

# Criticisms

The Open Philanthropy Project has been criticized on *The Huffington Post* by Leah Hunt-Hendrix for not focusing enough on systemic (or root) change and for "perpetuating inequality".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-hunthendrix/so-you-want-to-be-a-radical-philanthropist_b_7181248.html |title=So You Want to Be a "Radical" Philanthropist? |first=Leah |last=Hunt-Hendrix |publisher=Huffington Post |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=March 20, 2016}}</ref>
