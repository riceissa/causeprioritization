<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The Open Philanthropy Project started out as GiveWell Labs in 2011 but made little progress until 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-open_phil_progress_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-open_phil_progress-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The name was changed to Open Philanthropy Project in August 2014<sup id="cite_ref-open_phil_progress_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-open_phil_progress-7">[7]</a></sup> to separate it from GiveWell and also to avoid exclusive association to GiveWell since it is a collaboration with Good Ventures. However even after this initial brand change, updates to Open Phil were still posted to the GiveWell blog.<sup id="cite_ref-openphil_formerly_gwl_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-openphil_formerly_gwl-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In April 2015, Open Phil announced a partnership with Kaitlyn Trigger and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" title="Mike Krieger">Mike Krieger</a> (co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram" title="Instagram">Instagram</a>). Trigger and Krieger pledged $750,000 over two years while Open Phil would provide information and include Trigger in team meetings.<sup id="cite_ref-vox_matthews_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vox_matthews-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-glasspockets_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-glasspockets-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced on the GiveWell blog that it would launch a separate website for Open Phil by the end of 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-project_update_9_17_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-project_update_9_17-11">[11]</a></sup> By February 2016, updates to Open Phil were posted to the Open Phil blog rather than the GiveWell blog (as was previously done).<sup id="cite_ref-gw_blog_archive_2016_02_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gw_blog_archive_2016_02-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of March 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project is not an independent organization i.e. it is still a collaboration between GiveWell and Good Ventures, who share office space and information (to an extent). However Open Phil is in the process of becoming an independent organization.<sup id="cite_ref-about_page_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-about_page-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>

On June 1, 2017, Open Phil split off from GiveWell as a limited liability
company. This was announced to the public on June 12 in blog posts on the
[GiveWell blog][gw_split_announce] and [Open Phil
blog][open_phil_split_announce].

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organizational_structure">Organizational structure</span></h2>
<p>Cari Tuna is the organization's president, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Karnofsky" title="Holden Karnofsky">Holden Karnofsky</a> is the executive director, and Elie Hassenfeld is the managing director. Open Phil also has several program officers for various focus areas (such as US policy and scientific research), research analysts, and other roles.<sup id="cite_ref-open_phil_team_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-open_phil_team-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Evaluation_process">Evaluation process</span></h2>
<p>Investigation for the Open Philanthropy Project is considered more difficult than the traditional work done for GiveWell due to the great uncertainty and inherent difficulty of comparing wildly different causes.<sup id="cite_ref-vox_matthews_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vox_matthews-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Open Phil divides its work into lower-depth investigations (also called shallow overviews), higher-depth investigations (including focus areas), and cross-cutting projects.<sup id="cite_ref-refining_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-refining-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Open Phil also practices "giving to learn", i.e. a process of committing to causes to better learn about them.<sup id="cite_ref-refining_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-refining-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-committing_to_causes_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-committing_to_causes-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Openbordersinfo_March_20_2016c-18">[18]</a></sup> Executive Director Holden Karnofksy has described Open Phil's approach as one of "hits-based giving", where they aim to have a portfolio of grants that maximizes the likelihood of a highly impactful grant.<sup id="cite_ref-hits_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hits-19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shallow_overviews">Shallow overviews</span></h3>
<p>The Open Philanthropy Project publishes shallow overviews of general causes.<sup id="cite_ref-shallow_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shallow-20">[20]</a></sup> The first shallow overview appears to have been published in April 2013,<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> but GiveWell appears to have first officially announced shallow overviews in a blog post in May 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-refining_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-refining-16">[16]</a></sup> As of September 2013, shallow investigations have been conducted in the areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_climate_change" class="mw-redirect" title="Anthropogenic climate change">anthropogenic climate change</a>, detection of near-Earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>, migration (intra-country and international), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering" title="Climate engineering">geoengineering</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_security" class="mw-redirect" title="Nuclear security">nuclear security</a>, business environment, infrastructure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, and the treatment of animals in industrial agriculture.<sup id="cite_ref-shallow_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shallow-20">[20]</a></sup> GiveWell co-executive director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Karnofsky" title="Holden Karnofsky">Holden Karnofsky</a> discussed more about the purpose of shallow overviews in a conversation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_What_We_Can" title="Giving What We Can">Giving What We Can</a> representatives and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism" title="Effective altruism">effective altruists</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Focus_areas">Focus areas</span></h2>
<p>The Open Philanthropy Project uses the term "cause" to describe a problem or opportunity that requires expertise in order to make good giving decisions. It uses the term "focus area" for causes with the highest level of priority.<sup id="cite_ref-focus_areas_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-focus_areas-23">[23]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Criminal_justice_reform">Criminal justice reform</span></h3>
<p>Open Phil is investigating criminal justice reform due to poor conditions in prisons and bipartisan agreement in the US. There are difficulties to this investigation because of lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trials" class="mw-redirect" title="Randomized controlled trials">randomized controlled trials</a> of interventions.<sup id="cite_ref-vox_matthews_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vox_matthews-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 2015, Holden Karnofsky announced that Open Phil had hired Chloe Cockburn (who was Advocacy and Policy Counsel for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>'s Campaign to End Mass Incarceration) as program officer for criminal justice reform.<sup id="cite_ref-chloe_hiring_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-chloe_hiring-32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Discussing the decision to hire Cockburn as part of a larger overview of the Open Philanthropy Project, Sydney Martin, not affiliated with Open Phil, wrote: "Trying to organize the political will to take on something like reforming the US incarceration system was nearly impossible. Let alone trying to stand against those that have millions invested in keeping the prison industry alive and well. It always felt that these sorts of reforms was David vs. Goliath. But with a large sum of money, and a lot of thoughtful careful effort, change seems to have a tangible future."<sup id="cite_ref-syd_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-syd-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
