A **moral offset** or **ethics offset** is an action (usually a payment) taken to counteract an immoral act in such a way that the world would prefer the immoral act followed by the moral offset rather than have neither actions take place.
For instance, a meat-eater may eat meat and then donate to an animal welfare charity in such a way that even animal welfare advocates would prefer this outcome to that of the meat-eater not eating meat and not donating to the charity.

[^offset]: I like this quote from the comment:

    > Cash transfers significantly relieve poverty of humans who are
    > alive today, and are fairly efficient at doing that. They are far
    > less efficient at helping or harming non-human animals or
    > increasing or reducing existential risk. Even if they have some
    > negative effect here or there (more meat-eating, or habitat
    > destruction, or carbon emissions) the cost of producing a
    > comparable benefit to offset it in that dimension will be small
    > compared to the cash transfer. E.g. an allocation of 90%
    > GiveDirectly, and 10% to offset charities (carbon reduction, meat
    > reduction, nuclear arms control, whatever) will wind up positive
    > on multiple metrics.

## Carbon offset

- "[The Reign of Recycling](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/the-reign-of-recycling.html?_r=2)":

    > [Thomas C. Kinnaman] concludes that the social good would be
    > optimized by subsidizing the recycling of some metals, and by
    > imposing a $15 tax on each ton of trash that goes to the landfill.
    > That tax would offset the environmental costs, chiefly the
    > greenhouse impact, and allow each municipality to make a
    > guilt-free choice based on local economics and its citizens’
    > wishes. The result, Dr. Kinnaman predicts, would be a lot less
    > recycling than there is today.
