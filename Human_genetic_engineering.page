From "[On the genetic architecture of intelligence and other quantitative traits](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3421v2.pdf)" by Stephen Hsu:

> The corresponding ethical issues are complex and deserve serious attention in
> what may be a relatively short interval before these capabilities become a
> reality.  Each society will decide for itself where to draw the line on human
> genetic engineering, but we can expect a diversity of perspectives. Almost
> certainly, some countries will allow genetic engineering, thereby opening the
> door for global elites who can afford to travel for access to reproductive
> technology. As with most technologies, the rich and powerful will be the
> first beneficiaries.  Eventually, though, I believe many countries will not
> only legalize human genetic engineering, but even make it a (voluntary) part
> of their national healthcare systems. The alternative would be inequality of
> a kind never before experienced in human history.
