In considering the ethics of aging, there is the problem of whether it is more important to bring more people into this world, or to keep older people alive.
This is important to consider because if (say) older people are not more valuable than younger people or people who don't yet exist, then [Life extension]() may not be as important as a cause.
Some considerations:

- Older people may have a lower quality of life compared to people who are yet to be born (and in general younger people) due to disease from old age.
- It may take less resources to keep older people alive than to raise new people to adulthood, but it may take less resources to simply bring new people into the world than to keep older people alive for a certain amount of time.
- Older people may be more valuable because of their historical/cultural knowledge (i.e. they are, in a sense, "walking history books").

Here is Gerald Gruman, quoted by Callahan[^callahan] (pg 27):

[^callahan]:
Daniel Callahan.
*Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society*.
1987.
Simon and Schuster.

> A life span that is truly modern in attaining humanist, meliorist, and individualist values still is ahead.
At present, the worth of the individual is not so much a fact as a goal.
This interpretation requires confronting the truism in contemporary culture that resources should be invested preferentially in the young, because they have a future and the elderly do not.
However in the furthering of a genuinely modern culture, it is the aging who actually have pride of place; they are where the action is, for they are something *new* as a large population sector.
The solving of their problems is a make-or-break task for the modern forces that brought them in[t]o being.
Moreover, the elderly, as individuals, face challenges *new* to themselves which call for successive, creative renewals of identity.
And as part of humanity, they live in a historically early, or *new* phrase of accelerated modernization.
*Thus, the aging population does have a future, as it becomes re-engaged at the frontier of modern cultural adaptation and realization through historical time.*

(I'm not sure the quote makes very much sense; I may have to go to the original to understand the full context.)

Callahan himself (pg 42):

> The elderly are in the best position to keep alive the *past*, to integrate the history of which they are a living link with that present which they share with younger generations.
This could be as valuable in our society as it was in preliterate societies.
The integration what was and what is, and how they cohere with each other, is something that only the elderly can provide within the confines of family and local community life.
Only they are in a position to have experienced some patterns and cycles; [...]

> Another way of understanding life-extension stuff is that it increases the number of people on earth at a given time, all else being equal. But the more obvious way to increase the number of people on earth is to promote births. Of course, there are transition costs to death: people really don't like dying. On the other hand, there may be diminishing returns to life, and people might prefer to improve their chances of being born, whatever that means. I am floating in the ether and am offered a tradeoff: I can increase my probability of existing, but this will decrease the length of my existence if I receive an existence. I'm not sure what probability-length tradeoff I'd choose as optimal.
