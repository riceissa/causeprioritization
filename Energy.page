- [Rural Electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAVkjEMwhSe5r3T_IJ4UI2Msfn9bBYU884eDnEloeHE/edit#heading=h.qqhijb44wb4w)

    > Review of rural electrification initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa and their impact on key outcomes like
    > health, income and educational attainment. The review was performed by a member of the Effective 
    > Altruism Quebec community to advise anonymous donors wishing to help relieve extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. The review does not currently recommend to the donors to allocate funds to this
    > sector, due to limited evidence of effectiveness, and no advantage in terms of cost-effectiveness
    > compared to benchmarks such as unconditional cash transfers.
