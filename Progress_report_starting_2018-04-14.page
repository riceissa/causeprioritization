This page describes progress on this wiki starting 2018-04-14 (for 80 hours).

# Plan

There are several choices I am trying to deicide between:

1. A continuation of summarizing views in AI safety, as described in [progress report 2018-03-08 to 2018-03-29]().
2. More reading in philosophy, e.g. population ethics.
3. Think more about a possible website or tool in cause prioritization (similar to the websites I have been building/helping to build, like [AIW](https://aiwatch.issarice.com/), [DDDP](https://github.com/riceissa/devec-demography-data-portal), [DLW](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/), and [CDP](https://github.com/riceissa/computing-data-project)).
4. I am interested in exploring arguments about the "great stagnation", which might not be a cause area in itself but is relevant to several causes.
5. I also want to explore "institution design" as a cause area. Paul Christiano and Robin Hanson come to mind as two people in/peripheral to EA/rationality who have written about this topic. The academic term might actually be ["mechanism design"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design).
6. I'm also interested in general world exploration.
