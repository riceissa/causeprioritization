**Life extension and overpopulation** is an important topic to consider when assessing the [Importance of life extension]().
In particular, many worry that advancements in life extension will lead to overpopulation, which in turn might lead to [unsustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability#Population) (see also [Malthusian catastrophe: Neo-Malthusian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe#Neo-Malthusian_theory)).

For instance John K. Davis, citing others, writes[^davis] (citations and alternations are in Davis):
