**Life extension and overpopulation** is an important topic to consider when assessing the [Importance of life extension]().
In particular, many worry that advancements in life extension will lead to overpopulation, which in turn might lead to [unsustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability#Population) (see also [Malthusian catastrophe: Neo-Malthusian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe#Neo-Malthusian_theory)).

For instance John K. Davis, citing others, writes (pg 29)[^davis] (citations and alternations are in Davis):

# Considerations

Aubrey de Grey [considers the following](https://web.archive.org/web/20071009192434/http://www.sens.org/concerns.htm#opop) regarding overpopulation:

> - worst-case rate of arrival of an overpopulation problem;
- chance that the problem will never arrive at all;
- options if and when it does;
- whose choice it should be to decide between those options.

# Overpopulation and animals

Davis says extending analysis to animals/other parts of the ecosystem is outside the scope of his paper, but this seems like a rather important thing to consider.
To quote[^davis] (pg 32):

> Neither will I discuss the welfare of the nonhuman part of the
> ecosystem, whether of other species or of the ecosystem as a whole.
> Admittedly, a Malthusian crisis will affect every living thing on Earth
> eventually, and those harms and benefits are tremendously important for
> life-extension ethics. My argument will show that the total benefits of
> widely available life-extension almost certainly outweigh the total
> harms for *humans*, but I do not claim that this is true for the rest of
> the ecosystem.
