**Life extension and overpopulation** is an important topic to consider when assessing the [Importance of life extension]().
In particular, many worry that advancements in life extension will lead to overpopulation, which in turn might lead to [unsustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability#Population) (see also [Malthusian catastrophe: Neo-Malthusian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe#Neo-Malthusian_theory)).

For instance John K. Davis, citing others, writes (pg 29)[^davis] (citations and alternations are in Davis):

# Considerations

Aubrey de Grey [considers the following](https://web.archive.org/web/20071009192434/http://www.sens.org/concerns.htm#opop) regarding overpopulation:

> - worst-case rate of arrival of an overpopulation problem;
- chance that the problem will never arrive at all;
- options if and when it does;
- whose choice it should be to decide between those options.

The final consideration is especially interesting.
de Grey argues that whether to employ life extension treatments (in spite of overpopulation) is a choice to be made by future generations, and that by not making treatments available as soon as possible (by doing anti-aging research) we deny future generations this choice.

# Overpopulation and animals

Davis says extending analysis to animals/other parts of the ecosystem is outside the scope of his paper, but this seems like a rather important thing to consider.
To quote[^davis] (pg 32):

> Neither will I discuss the welfare of the nonhuman part of the
> ecosystem, whether of other species or of the ecosystem as a whole.
> Admittedly, a Malthusian crisis will affect every living thing on Earth
> eventually, and those harms and benefits are tremendously important for
> life-extension ethics. My argument will show that the total benefits of
> widely available life-extension almost certainly outweigh the total
> harms for *humans*, but I do not claim that this is true for the rest of
> the ecosystem.

# Questions

Building off de Grey's and Davis' considerations, we can come up with a few questions regarding life extension and overpopulation:

- To what extent will life extension lead to overpopulation?---Will it happen at all?
- What are some ways to deal with overpopulation if it does happen? (de Grey mentions denial of treatments and restriction of births, and briefly considers the possibility---or rather untenability---of expanding into space.)
- Does not working on anti-aging research today deny the choice of future generations to employ life extension treatments?---If so, are we allowed to do this?
- What are the likely consequences of overpopulation for humans?
For animals?
Is better or worse than having these people die instead?
