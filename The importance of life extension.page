From "Myth \# 10" on [this page](http://senescence.info/physical_immortality_myths.html):

> Clearly, there are many problems and injustices in our world. Many
> nations face war, hunger, poverty, and epidemics. Yet, as
> mentioned in regard to the justice issue on myth \#5, this does
> not mean industrialized nations must abandon expensive medicines.
> Besides, more often than not the problems of third world countries
> are political, not technological. For example, hunger is usually
> caused not by a lack of food per se but rather by the inability to
> deliver food due to war, anarchy, tyranny, etc.
> 
> Aging is the major problem we face in modern society. It is or
> will be the [major cause of
> suffering](http://senescence.info/death_and_aging_fears.html) and
> pain for me and the ones I love. This holds true for most nations
> nowadays and that is why fighting aging must be a top priority.
