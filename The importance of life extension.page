From "Myth \# 10" on [this page](http://senescence.info/physical_immortality_myths.html):

> Clearly, there are many problems and injustices in our world. Many
> nations face war, hunger, poverty, and epidemics. Yet, as
> mentioned in regard to the justice issue on myth \#5, this does
> not mean industrialized nations must abandon expensive medicines.
> Besides, more often than not the problems of third world countries
> are political, not technological. For example, hunger is usually
> caused not by a lack of food per se but rather by the inability to
> deliver food due to war, anarchy, tyranny, etc.
> 
> Aging is the major problem we face in modern society. It is or
> will be the [major cause of
> suffering](http://senescence.info/death_and_aging_fears.html) and
> pain for me and the ones I love. This holds true for most nations
> nowadays and that is why fighting aging must be a top priority.

> Cumulative gains in
life expectancy after 1900 were worth over $1.2 million to the representative American in 2000, whereas post-1970 gains added about
$3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, equal to about half of GDP.

From their conclusion (p\ 902):

> Prospectively, even modest progress against diseases such as cancer
and heart disease would have enormous social values. A 1 percent
reduction in mortality from cancer or heart disease would be worth nearly
$500 billion to current and future Americans. These estimates ignore
the value of health advances to individuals in other countries, so they
understate aggregate social values of possible innovations. They also
ignore corresponding improvements in the quality of life---which
evidence suggests may be even more valuable than gains in longevity---and
for these reasons as well they are likely to be conservative. We show
that these values will increase in the future because of economic growth
and, more interestingly, because health itself continues to improve.
>
> Large as they are, these values may be offset by the costs of developing
and implementing health improvements. Current public and private
spending on health-related research is a tiny fraction of potential benefits,
yet such investments may not be worthwhile if the costs of implementing new
technologies are large. Social transfer programs and other
third-party methods of financing health care can distort both utilization
decisions and research, with the result that some health improvements
are socially inefficient.
