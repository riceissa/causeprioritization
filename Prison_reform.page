# Problem 

Millions of people around the world are isolated from most forms of meaningful social interaction, deprived of their political rights and given minimal economic opportunities. [CITATION NEEDED] 

# Scope 

[According](https://web.archive.org/web/20120504053736/http://www.idcr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/WPPL-9-22.pdf) to the International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS) 

"More than 10.1 million people are held in penal institutions throughout the world, mostly as pre-trial detainees/remand prisoners or as sentenced prisoners. Almost half of these are in the United States (2.29m), Russia (0.81m) or China (1.65m sentenced prisoners). In addition, more than 650,000 are in "detention centers" in China; if these are included the overall Chinese total is over 2.3 million and the world total more than 10.75 million."

While crime [decreased](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/) since the 1990’s, the incarceration rate did not. In fact, the number of persons supervised by U.S. adult correctional systems has [increased](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus14.pdf).

Prisons, jails, probation, and parole cost around [$74 billion](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jee8207st.pdf) in 2007 according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
