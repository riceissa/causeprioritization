    > On balance, it seems that the positive externalities [of genetic
    > selection] would dominate â€“ at least this is commonly assumed in
    > the context of other interventions aimed at improving cognitive
    > performance, such as education and removal of neurotoxic
    > pollutants, which are commonly subsidized for this reason.
