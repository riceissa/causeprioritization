Intelligence enhancement refers to significantly enhancing the intelligence of humans, often by genetic means.

# Progress

## Polygenic score

From [Embryo selection for intelligence](https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection):

> the best 2016 polygenic score could achieve a gain of ~3 IQ points when selecting out of 10

# Interesting quotes

From [Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game-changer?](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf):

    > On balance, it seems that the positive externalities [of genetic selection] would dominate – at least this is commonly assumed in the context of other interventions aimed at improving cognitive performance, such as education and removal of neurotoxic pollutants, which are commonly subsidized for this reason.
