From a [differential progress](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/differential-progress/) framework, there a lot of uncertainty and disagreement about whether whole brain emulation should be pushed forward.

Two reports investigating this question are:  
- [Singularity Summit 2011 Workshop Report](https://intelligence.org/files/SS11Workshop.pdf)  
- [Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf) by the Future of Humanity Institute  

Three key technologies need to be developed to get to whole brain emulations:  
- scanning  
- modeling  
- computing  
Which of those is developed last will influence the dynamics of the transition to a world with emulated minds.

In his book [The Age of Em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Em), Robin Hanson makes an extensive analysis of how a world of emulated minds (ems) would work assuming its development isn't globally coordinated and that proprietary rights are respected.
