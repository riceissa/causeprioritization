[GiveWell thinks that](http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/) the biggest room for improvement in large-scale foundations is in cause selection:

> \[Cause selection\] is where existing philanthropists seem to be least thoughtful and to ask the fewest critical questions; yet this is where we’d guess the bulk of variation in “how much good a philanthropist accomplishes” comes from.

# Notes

Michael Huemer, §8.1.2 in *The Problem of Political Authority*, while not
speaking specifically about cause prioritization, discusses the importance of
not being emotionally attached to certain "social issues":

> When evaluating a social system, we must consider all of the advantages and
> disadvantages of that system. We should not allow our evaluation to be unduly
> influenced by any single social issue.
> 
> Imagine a social activist, whom I shall call ‘Mom’, whose favorite social
> issue is drunk driving. She attends rallies against drunk driving, quotes
> statistics about the problem to her friends, and writes letters to her
> congressman and the local newspapers urging tougher laws to combat drunk
> driving. Mom knows that there are many other serious social problems;
> nevertheless, none call forth from her the same passion. This sort of
> phenomenon, I trust, is familiar enough; every social issue has its Moms.
> Suppose, furthermore, that Mom becomes convinced that anarchy, while it may
> adequately address every other problem, cannot address the problem of drunk
> driving nearly as well as some governmental system. As a result, Mom finds
> herself unable to accept anarchism.
> 
> The story of Mom is meant to illustrate a psychological point: we have
> emotional attachments to specific social issues which are often
> disproportionate to the objective significance of those issues, and these
> emotional attachments can bias our evaluation of social theories. Thinkers
> must become aware of this problem to guard against it. We must recognize the
> possibility that the system that is overall best for society may not solve
> all problems and may not solve the problems to which we feel the greatest
> psychological commitment.
