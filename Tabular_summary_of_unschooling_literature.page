  <td>Investigates the use of of a "mathematics studio" (specifically a studio called "Escher's World" at the MIT Media Lab) to explore how students learn mathematics (specifically the concept of symmetry) in a "relaxed atmosphere" where they are free to work in workshops that are equipped with computers and other materials (pg 97–98).
The study conducted interviews before and after the workshop and two to five months afterwards (as a followup).
Other forms of data collection were also used (video recordings, field notes, written surveys).</td>

<p>Shaffer notes that "[s]tudents used a richer, more formal, more analytical, and more mathematical vocabulary to describe images after the workshop" (pg 100), and that most learned how to make designs using symmetry and explain the concept of symmetry.
The students also began to use "visual problem solving strategies after the workshop" in word problems that were unrelated to symmetry, and even reported liking math more (pg 101–102).
The study concludes (pg 111):</p>

<blockquote>the results from Escher’s World show that expression and expressive activities have a noticeable affective influence on the process of learning, and that therefore, expression can play a positive role in mathematics education by helping students control their own learning.</blockquote>

  <td>None.</td>
  <td>Examined various other papers on the role of video games in science education.</td>
  <td><p>As they explain in their paper (pg 16):</p>

<blockquote>Informal learning environments—like games—ultimately are fueled by interest- or passion-driven learning. This characteristic represents a key opportunity for games-based researchers (and a challenge for educators in formal educational settings). Informal science educators, like game designers, have the task of designing enticing learning experiences in which learners feel compelled to learn more</blockquote>

<p>They outline previous research finding that video games help with "collective participation and customized learning" (pg 15), scientific literacy, and in gaining "proto-experiences of authentic (as opposed to contrived) investigation" (pg 14).
In addition participation in "epistemic games" (i.e. role-playing games that aren't video games, but where students pretend to be professionals) "has resulted in positive gains in knowledge, skills, and attitudes as measured by traditional tests, clinical interviews, and concept maps" (pg 13).

  <td>The efficacy of these games is a small testament to the potential of self directed, “interest- or passion driven learning”.</td>
