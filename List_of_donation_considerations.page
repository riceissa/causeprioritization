Donors concerned with effective giving have many considerations as they
think through their decision. These include:

|Consideration|Type of consideration|Examples|
|----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Giving now vs later|Donor optimization of own resources||
|[Donor coordination and giver's dilemma](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/)|Other donors||
|Donating to a single charity vs multiple charities ([donation splitting]())|Donor optimization of own resources||
|How to weigh local knowledge vs analyses published by others|Donee evaluation||
|How much to spend on research for a donation versus actually making a donation|Donor optimization of own resources||
|Which population ethics to use|Donor values||
|Which worldviews to use, and what entities to see as "equal" (all animals? all humans? all people with a certain IQ or ability?)|Donor values||
|How much weight to place on cost-effectiveness calculations vs less quantitative forms of modeling and reasoning|Donee evaluation||
|Size of average donation (relative to total wealth)|Donor optimization of own resources||
|Whether to donate to organizations or individuals or fund one's pet projects|||
|Whether to use a donor-advised fund|||
|Ways to use donations to influence donee incentives|||
|What sort of transparency or public visibility to demand of donees|||

The list was seeded by the one in [this post](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1s3/donations_list_website_tutorial_and_request_for/#systematically-track-considerations-that-donors-make), which I wrote.
