think through their decision. These include:

|Consideration|Type of consideration|Examples|

|Giving now vs later|Donor optimization of own resources; donor values||
|Donor coordination and giver's dilemma|Other donors|[GiveWell](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/), [Denis Drescher](https://claviger.net/concept-for-donor-coordination.html)|

|How to weigh local knowledge vs analyses published by others|Donee evaluation||
|How much to spend on research for a donation versus actually making a donation|Donor optimization of own resources||
|Which population ethics to use|Donor values||
|Which worldviews to use, and what entities to see as "equal" (all animals? all humans? all people with a certain IQ or ability?)|Donor values||

The list was seeded by the one in [this post](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1s3/donations_list_website_tutorial_and_request_for/#systematically-track-considerations-that-donors-make), which I wrote.
