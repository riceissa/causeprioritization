Donors concerned with effective giving have many considerations as they
think through their decision. These include:

* Giving now vs later
* [Donor coordination and giver's dilemma](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/)
* Donating to a single charity vs multiple charities
* How to weigh local knowledge vs analyses published by others
* How much weight to place on cost-effectiveness calculations vs less quantitative forms of modeling and reasoning
* Whether to use a donor-advised fund
* Size of average donation (relative to total wealth)
* Which population ethics to use
* Which worldviews to use, and what entities to see as "equal" (all animals? all humans?
all people with a certain IQ or ability?)

The list was seeded by the one in [this post](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1s3/donations_list_website_tutorial_and_request_for/#systematically-track-considerations-that-donors-make), which I wrote.
