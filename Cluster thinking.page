**Cluster thinking** is a kind of thinking where one separates various perspectives, weighs each, then comes to a final conclusion.
It contrasts with [Sequence thinking]().
It was first outlined by Holden Karnofsky in his GiveWell blog post "[Sequence Thinking vs. Cluster Thinking](http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/)".
