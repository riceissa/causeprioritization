    > Rudimentary d-mod technologies already exist, and are already big
    > business. The main examples are antidepressant medication such as
    > Prozac, recreational pleasure drugs such as Ecstasy, and "study
    > drugs" such as Adderall. Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus
    > accumbens, used to combat severe depression, is another example. A
    > third is meditation, which is used to increase calmness and
    > sometimes reduce certain desires (remember, skills and techniques
    > also count as "technologies" - Buddhists and others have been
    > exploring d-mod for thousands of years). Motivational speakers,
    > self-help books and courses, and psychotherapy also partly fall
    > into the d-mod category. So the market is already there; d-mod is
    > a product that sells itself.

    > All of this suggests that human preferences are surprisingly
    > plastic. Not completely plastic mind you, but still, we have a big

    > or undesirable. Yes we usually can’t just individually will
    > ourselves to love what we hated a few hours ago. But the net
    > effect of all our experience over a lifetime is huge.

    > It seems that this should make us worry less that future folks
    > will be happy. Even if it seems that future folks will have to do
    > or experience things that we today would find unpleasant, future
    > culture could change people so that they find these new things
    > pleasant instead. Yes, if change happens very fast it might take
    > culture time to adapt, and there could be a lot of unhappy people
    > during the transition. And yes there are probably limits beyond
    > which culture can’t make us like things. But within a wide range
    > of actions and experiences, future folks can learn to like
    > whatever it is that their world requires.
