Martin-Chang S, Gould O, Meuse R. The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from homeschooled and traditionally schooled students. *Canadian Journal Of Behavioural Science/Revue Canadienne Des Sciences Du Comportement* [serial online].

> Although homeschooling is growing in prevalence, its educational outcomes remain unclear. The present
study compared the academic achievements of homeschooled children with children attending traditional
public school. When the homeschooled group was divided into those who were taught from organized
lesson plans (structured homeschoolers) and those who were not (unstructured homeschoolers), the data
showed that structured homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared with
children attending public school. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the unstructured homeschoolers
are achieving the lowest standardized scores across the 3 groups.

> In any study of this nature, it is difficult to rebut many of the
issues surrounding self-selection. Many homeschooling families
are not registered with the local governments or school boards
(Arai, 2000; Lines, 1991), and this effectively rules out the pos-
sibility of randomized sampling.
