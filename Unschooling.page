Martin-Chang et al[^martinchang], in their abstract:

Martin-Chang S, Gould O, Meuse R. The impact of schooling on academic achievement: Evidence from homeschooled and traditionally schooled students. *Canadian Journal Of Behavioural Science/Revue Canadienne Des Sciences Du Comportement* [serial online]. July 2011;43(3):195-202. Available from: PsycARTICLES, Ipswich, MA. Accessed March 3, 2015.

> Although homeschooling is growing in prevalence, its educational outcomes remain unclear. The present
study compared the academic achievements of homeschooled children with children attending traditional
public school. When the homeschooled group was divided into those who were taught from organized
lesson plans (structured homeschoolers) and those who were not (unstructured homeschoolers), the data
showed that structured homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared with
children attending public school. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the unstructured homeschoolers
are achieving the lowest standardized scores across the 3 groups.

Page 195:

> In any study of this nature, it is difficult to rebut many of the
issues surrounding self-selection. Many homeschooling families
are not registered with the local governments or school boards
(Arai, 2000; Lines, 1991), and this effectively rules out the
possibility of randomized sampling.

Page 196, talking about Ray (2010):

> Homeschoolers
who obtained the highest scores came from high-income families
with university-educated parents, who invested at least $600 each
year (per child) on educational materials. Student success was also
associated with higher amounts of overall “structure” in the
homeschooling program and greater amounts of time engaged in formal
instruction (e.g., lessons).
