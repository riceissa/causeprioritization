Discussion and investigation about unschooling is difficult for several reasons. First, it is difficult to agree on just what "unschooling" means, with the result that different authors have used the term in slightly different ways.

Another issue with investigating the topic (very similar to the previous one) is that different authors have used different terms to refer to unschooling, so that organizing all of the research on the topic is cumbersome. In the course of this research, we have encountered terms such as "unstructured learning", "progressive education", "self-directed learning", and so on. For instance, Gardner (1991) writes of progressive education (pg 193):

> [P]rogressive educators [...] favored rich projects through which children could come to know their world, achieve a fuller understanding of themselves, and begin to secure a feeling for the skills and concepts that lay at the heart of formal disciplines.
> 
> Because progressive educators shunned formulas, the schools created in the light of this philosophy were quite varied, in daily procedures as well as in administrative organization and in overall quality.

This is very similar to what we mean by "unschooling", and the quote also underscores the differences in implementation.

A third, more practical, issue with investigating unschooling is the lack of research into the subject. Martin-Chang et al. (2011, pg 201), talking about research on homeschooling (which itself has more research done on it than on unschooling) concludes:

> [T]he increasing popularity of homeschooling is at odds with the dearth of scientific research being conducted in this area. As argued by Isenberg (2007), “Despite its size, scarce data on homeschooling have impaired our understanding of even the most basic questions” (p. 387). Practical restraints such as the heterogeneity of the population and difficulties in obtaining adequate sample sizes make homeschooling a challenging field of study.

Indeed, in contrast to the 25 structured homeschooled children and 37 public school children that Martin-Chang et al. studied, only 12 unstructured homeschooled children were participants, which was few enough in number that they were unable to include the results of the analysis of unstructured homeschooled children in their main findings (instead relegating that to the very end of their results section) (pg 198).

Even with these difficulties though, it is still possible to conclude some things about unschooling. For instance, Ray (2010) conducted a "nationwide cross-sectional, descriptive study" to determine the educational attainment as well as many demographic features (e.g. age, family income, computer use) of homeschoolers, which notably included data on unstructured learners (defined by him in the survey as a learning style "centered upon the child's interests or the eclectic nature of the teaching parent"). It is important first to note that the sample of homeschoolers examined by Ray (2010) has a similar limitation to most other studies on homeschoolers, namely that the participants were self-selected (as opposed to a random sample), meaning the participants could potentially be, say, some of the highest-achieving homeschoolers. In addition to this Martin-Chang et al. (2011) writes (pg 196) of Ray (2010):

> [T]he population comprised only those homeschoolers who used the services of academic testing companies. In addition, many of these parents earned higher incomes than the general population.

Thus it is important to keep this in mind when looking at the results of Ray (2010). The study examined both the overall structure in the approach to learning (i.e. structured versus unstructured), as well as the amount of time spent per day on structured activities. In both cases, a statistically significant relationship was found between structure and test scores, favoring more structure. However, the degree and amount of structure each only accounted for about 0.5% of the variance in the scores.

Ray (2010) did find that (consistent with other research on homeschoolers), the homeschooling population had "exceptionally high" test scores compared to those in public schools. Since the degree and amount of structure did not explain much of the variance in scores among homeschoolers, this does mean that (at least with this possibly highly biased sample) even unstructured learners scored above public school students (on average).

Martin-Chang (2011) also studied students in public schools, as well as homeschoolers with both a structured and unstructured environment, specifically to determine educational achievement. Their sample is slightly less useful in that the participants' age range was from 5 to 10 years old, which could mean that any differences in scores could amplify or even out given more years (or even do something more unusual). The study found that "structured homeschooling were superior to the children enrolled in public school across all seven subtests" (pg 199), and that in terms of overall achievement, structured homeschoolers had higher scores even accounting for family income and the mother's educational attainment (pg 199). The study found, however, that unstructured homeschoolers overall had lower scores than both the structured homeschoolers and the public school students. Compared to the structured homeschoolers, the unstructured group differed in scores from 1.32 to 4.20 grade levels, depending on the test. Compared to the public school group, the unstructured group had scores that were lower but within about one grade level. In terms of the "difference scores in grade levels", i.e. the students' actual score minus the predicted score, the unstructured group scored within one grade level in each of the subtests, indicating that they are performing at within one grade level of what is expected of them.

It is important to note, however, that some of these tests may uniquely disadvantage unstructured learners. For instance, one of the tests, "Word Attack" is "a measure of pure decoding. It contains 30 nonwords that children are asked to read aloud according to conventional spelling–sound conversion rules." (pg 198) For students who have no gone through any sort of formal reading curriculum, trying to pronounce nonwords may be an especially difficult task. The Word Attack test, after all, was patterned after an exercise practiced in structured phonetics education. In addition, with the very small sample size of 12, as well as the young age of the participants, it is difficult to conclude anything.

A qualitative survey of 232 self-identified unschoolers by Gray (2013) notes many advantages of unschooling. For instance, over half the respondents indicated that children were “learning more efficiently and eagerly, and learning more life-relevant material, than they would if they were in school”, as well as citing greater curiosity and intrinsic interest (pg 16). In addition, over half the respondents also noted that their “children were happier, less stressed, more self-confident, more agreeable” (pg 16). It is important to note, however, that the respondents were self-selected and that the survey questions were open-ended (pg 18-19).

In contemporary scholarship Peter Gray, who conducted the survey above, looms large. In *Free to Learn*, he focuses on the concept of *free play*. Along the way, he puts many of Holt’s ideas on a firmer psychological footing and examines a modern day version of the Ny Lilleskole, the Sudbury Valley Free School.

Gray begins by examining hunter-gatherer societies, since humans are genetically adapted to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and mode of subsistence.
Evolutionarily modern humans are believed to have subsisted in small hunter-gatherer bands for the vast majority of their time on earth.
Gray writes, “If we take, arbitrarily, a million years ago for the beginning of human history, then for 99 percent of that history we were all hunter-gatherers” (23).
Hunter-gatherers, according to Gray, “are remarkably similar in certain basic ways.
They have similar social structures, similar values, and similar ways of raising children” (23).
In particular, hunter-gatherers are egalitarian, and they value individual freedom and sharing (24).
This is reflected in the enormous amount of freedom their children enjoy.
Gray and a graduate student surveyed “ten prominent researchers who had studied various hunter-gatherer cultures.
To our question, ‘How much free time did children in the group you studied have for play, all of the researchers said, essentially, that the children were free to play nearly from dawn until dusk every day (Gray 28).
According to the same researchers, hunter-gatherer children “mimic many valued adult activities in their play” (33).
Gray later generalizes this to argue that children tend to play at whatever activities are culturally valued (112-113).
Hunter-gatherer children also played cooperatively in mixed-age groups, something that Gray viewed as crucial (35).
In part because of this, instead of formally competing, hunter-gatherer children typically played in a way that was “informal and noncompetitive” (Gray 35).
Indeed, “even their formal games, which have explicit rules and could be played competitively, are played noncompetitively” (Gray 35).

Gray then traces the evolution of modern compulsory schooling and the decline in play.
He argues that play declined when agriculture provided a useful outlet for unskilled labor, explaining, “The hunter-gatherer way of life was knowledge-intensive and skill-intensive, but not labor-intensive” (Gray 44), while “Successful farming required long hours of relatively unskilled, repetitive labor” (Gray 45).
The stratified societies, based on rights to arable land, that agriculture supported eventually led to feudal structures where obedience, not autonomy, was a prerequisite for survival (51-52).
The parallel development of hierarchical religion spawned the idea that children were naturally bad and needed to be whipped into shape; as the Bible has it, “Foolishness is bound up in the heart of  a child, but the rod of correction will drive it far from him” (Proverbs 22:15, quoted in Gray 55).
This idea later combined with Protestant ideals of hard work to inform compulsory religious schools where “The goal was indoctrination, not inquisitiveness” (Gray 57).
Finally, the state co-opted education to teach good citizenship.
Gray cites many proponents of compulsory education who wanted to, in the words of “one of the founders of American sociology” (63), “‘collect little plastic lumps of human dough from private households and shape them on the social kneading-board’” (quoted in Gray, 63).
Religious and state indoctrination, then, set the precedent for our educational system today.

Gray asserts that this precedent gave rise to a litany of problems with our educational system, which he calls the “seven sins of our system of forced education” (66), of which four seemed most compelling.
First, Gray cites the, “Interference with the development of personal responsibility and self-direction” (69).
Second, Gray laments the “Undermining of intrinsic motivation to learn (turning learning into work)” (71).
This ties into research Gray later discusses regarding the behavior of elementary students given rewards for drawing with felt-tip pens, an activity they already enjoyed (148).
In contrast with the control group and those who were rewarded unexpectedly, students that were rewarded for their drawings produced “significantly worse drawings… as judged by evaluators who did not know which group the drawings were coming from” (Gray 145).
And, they “spent only about half as much time drawing with felt-tip pens, in subsequent free play sessions” (Gray 148).
Rewards certainly undermined intrinsic motivation to play, which in Gray’s thought is synonymous with reducing their motivation to learn.

Gray declaims the third major “sin” of compulsory education as “Judging students in ways that foster shame, hubris, cynicism, and cheating” (72).
To explain the results of anonymous questionnaires that found “roughly 70 percent [of students surveyed] admit to repeated acts of the most blatant forms of cheating, such as copying whole tests from other students or plagiarizing whole papers” (Gray 74), Gray argues that “Students understand that the rules distinguishing cheating from not cheating in school are like the rules of a game.
But it’s a game they did not choose to play.
They have little or no say in what they study, how they are tested… Under these conditions, it’s hard to respect the rules” (74).
According to Gray’s account, compulsory schools clearly fail to provide a healthy moral environment for children.
Finally, Gray charges compulsory schools with “Interference with the development of cooperation and promotion of bullying” (76).
He cites documented trends of increasing narcissism “(defined as excessive self-concern and lack of concern for others) among young people” (Gray 77) as a response to increasingly controlling and competitive, not to mention age-segregated, schools.
Later, when Gray describes age-mixed free schools, he discusses observations of older children stepping in to stop bullying (103).
He also cites evidence that contact with younger children (babies) makes students kinder and more cooperative (199-200).

The next part of the book is devoted to Sudbury schools. These schools are dedicated to enabling age-mixed free play--I’ll describe them further in Conclusions. I do want to mention a few more ideas that cements the link between play and learning in Gray’s mind.

First, Gray discusses the concept, developed by Lev Vyotsky, that a child in free play is actually following complex internal rules. Vyotsky “wrote about two actual sisters… who sometimes played that they were sisters. As actual sisters, they rarely thought about their sisterhood and had no consistent way of behaving towards each other… But when they were playing sisters, they always behaved according to their shared stereotype of how sisters should behave… Much more self-control, mental effort, and rule-following was involved in playing sisters than in being sisters” (Gray 147). Gray then relates Vyotsky’s concusion that “the child’s desire to play is so strong that it becomes a motivating force for learning self-control” (Gray 148-149). This is one of the reasons Gray offers to explain Sudbury students’ high self-reported responsibility and self-control.

Finally, Grey discusses the benefits of the playful mood for creativity and working with hypothetical situations. He cites multiple studies that show that evaluation and the resulting “serious” frame of mind interfere with learning (132-135). He also cites studies demonstrating that inducing a playful mood helps college students to solve puzzles, physicians to arrive at correct diagnoses, and young children to solve logic problems that require considering hypotheticals and accepting statements that are not true in reality (Gray 136-139). This idea serves to strengthen the bonds Gray infers between play and learning.

Gray’s arguments, drawing from sociology, psychology, and personal observation, comprise an idiosyncratic but fairly compelling case against structured education.

In the spirit of Gray, we examined a good deal of research, that, while not directly focused on unschooling, nevertheless has relevance to important questions about unschooling.

Dynan et al. (2008) examined the acquisition of self-directed learning skills in structured and unstructured learning environments.
The study quotes Knowles (1975) and defines "self-directed learning" (SDL) as "a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes" (pg 96).
The study was conducted through an upper level business school course, where one section was taught with more structure while the other gave students more freedom; about 250 students participated in total.
The participants (who were students in the courses) were given a pretest and a posttest to determine their "SDL readiness".
The study found that although both the structured and unstructured forms of the course raised students' SDL scores, the more important indicator was whether the learning environment matched the students' SDL readiness.
In other words, the students with higher SDL scores (i.e. those who were more self-directed learners) thrived in an unstructured environment and become more self-directed, and conversely for those who didn't have high SDL scores, the structured environment seemed to raise their SDL scores more reliably.

In addition to studies that assess structured versus unstructured learning generally (as in the studies examined so far), there are also studies that look at specific topics.
Below we look at math education in the form of a "mathematics studio" and a study on using video games for learning.
Shaffer (1997) investigates the use of of a "mathematics studio" (specifically a studio called "Escher's World" at the MIT Media Lab) to explore how students learn mathematics (specifically the concept of symmetry) in a "relaxed atmosphere" where they are free to work in workshops that are equipped with computers and other materials (pg 97–98).
The study conducted interviews before and after the workshop and two to five months afterwards (as a followup).
Other forms of data collection were also used (video recordings, field notes, written surveys).
Shaffer notes that "[s]tudents used a richer, more formal, more analytical, and more mathematical vocabulary to describe images after the workshop" (pg 100), and that most learned how to make designs using symmetry and explain the concept of symmetry.
The students also began to use "visual problem solving strategies after the workshop" in word problems that were unrelated to symmetry, and even reported liking math more (pg 101–102).
The study concludes (pg 111):

> the results from Escher’s World show that expression and expressive activities have a noticeable affective influence on the process of learning, and that therefore, expression can play a positive role in mathematics education by helping students control their own learning.

Squire and Patterson (2010) examined various other papers on the role of video games in science education. As they explain in their paper (pg 16):

> Informal learning environments—like games—ultimately are fueled by interest- or passion-driven learning. This characteristic represents a key opportunity for games-based researchers (and a challenge for educators in formal educational settings). Informal science educators, like game designers, have the task of designing enticing learning experiences in which learners feel compelled to learn more

They outline previous research finding that video games help with "collective participation and customized learning" (pg 15), scientific literacy, and in gaining "proto-experiences of authentic (as opposed to contrived) investigation" (pg 14).
In addition participation in "epistemic games" (i.e. role-playing games that aren't video games, but where students pretend to be professionals) "has resulted in positive gains in knowledge, skills, and attitudes as measured by traditional tests, clinical interviews, and concept maps" (pg 13).
The efficacy of these games is a small testament to the potential of self directed, “interest- or passion driven learning”.

> Although homeschooling is growing in prevalence, its educational outcomes remain unclear. The present
study compared the academic achievements of homeschooled children with children attending traditional
public school. When the homeschooled group was divided into those who were taught from organized
lesson plans (structured homeschoolers) and those who were not (unstructured homeschoolers), the data
showed that structured homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared with
children attending public school. Exploratory analyses also suggest that the unstructured homeschoolers
are achieving the lowest standardized scores across the 3 groups.

Page 195:

> In any study of this nature, it is difficult to rebut many of the
issues surrounding self-selection. Many homeschooling families
are not registered with the local governments or school boards
(Arai, 2000; Lines, 1991), and this effectively rules out the
possibility of randomized sampling.

Page 196, talking about Ray (2010):

> Homeschoolers
who obtained the highest scores came from high-income families
with university-educated parents, who invested at least $600 each
year (per child) on educational materials. Student success was also
associated with higher amounts of overall “structure” in the
homeschooling program and greater amounts of time engaged in formal
instruction (e.g., lessons).
