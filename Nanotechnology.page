GiveWell / Open Philanthropy Project has conversation notes about this (e.g. interviews with K. Eric Drexler).
K. Eric Drexler's "Engines of Creation" is a popular outline of the impact of nanotechnology. His PhD thesis "Nanosystems" is a more in-depth, rigorous treatment of similar ideas.

Nanotechnology could be a source of existential risk. Although Drexler and other experts have [questioned](http://iopscience.iop.org/0957-4484/15/8/001/) the likelihood of the [grey goo scenario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo), there are still worries that nanotechnology could be used to build very powerful weapons in large quantities (perhaps in an arms race).

See some discussion [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bnc/against_ai_risk/6axy). In particular, in [this comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bnc/against_ai_risk/6ayx) Carl Shulman says "I've probably put 50-300 hours (depending on how inclusive a criterion I use for relevant hours) into the topic, and saw diminishing returns. If I overlap with Eric Drexler or such folk at a venue I would inquire, and I would read a novel contribution, but I'm not going to be putting much into it given my alternatives soon."

- [Risks from atomically precise manufacturing](http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/atomically-precise-manufacturing): "some argue that it would help make it possible to create tiny self-replicating machines that could consume the Earth’s resources in a scenario known as “grey goo,” but such machines would have to be designed deliberately and we are highly uncertain of whether it would be possible to make them".
