  <td>Investigates the use of of a "mathematics studio" (specifically a studio called "Escher's World" at the MIT Media Lab) to explore how students learn mathematics (specifically the concept of symmetry) in a "relaxed atmosphere" where they are free to work in workshops that are equipped with computers and other materials (pg 97–98).
The study conducted interviews before and after the workshop and two to five months afterwards (as a followup).
Other forms of data collection were also used (video recordings, field notes, written surveys).</td>
