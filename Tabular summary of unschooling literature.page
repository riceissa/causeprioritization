  <td>Investigates the use of of a "mathematics studio" (specifically a studio called "Escher's World" at the MIT Media Lab) to explore how students learn mathematics (specifically the concept of symmetry) in a "relaxed atmosphere" where they are free to work in workshops that are equipped with computers and other materials (pg 97–98).
The study conducted interviews before and after the workshop and two to five months afterwards (as a followup).
Other forms of data collection were also used (video recordings, field notes, written surveys).</td>

<p>Shaffer notes that "[s]tudents used a richer, more formal, more analytical, and more mathematical vocabulary to describe images after the workshop" (pg 100), and that most learned how to make designs using symmetry and explain the concept of symmetry.
The students also began to use "visual problem solving strategies after the workshop" in word problems that were unrelated to symmetry, and even reported liking math more (pg 101–102).
The study concludes (pg 111):</p>

<blockquote>the results from Escher’s World show that expression and expressive activities have a noticeable affective influence on the process of learning, and that therefore, expression can play a positive role in mathematics education by helping students control their own learning.</blockquote>
