Argument for delaying solar geoengineering research.^[[The case for delaying solar geoengineering research](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bKHjJBkfdHhA3SFJh/the-case-for-delaying-solar-geoengineering-research)]

> 1. Solar geoengineering is not feasible for the next few decades.
> - Solar geoengineering poses major governance challenges.
> - These governance challenges are only likely to be overcome in at least 50 yearsâ€™ time.
> 
> 2. Solar geoengineering research is a moral hazard, and research might uncover dangerous weather manipulation methods.
> 
> 3. Given this risk and given that we can delay research without obvious costs, there is a good case for delaying solar geoengineering research at least for a few decades.
