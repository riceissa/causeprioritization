This page describes progress on this wiki from 2018-03-08 to 2018-03-29. All the work in this period was by Issa.

# Plan

There was no plan written beforehand for this period.

# What was accomplished

Most of the work in this period was done in AI safety. The basic motivation for this work comes from the following observations:

- There has been quite a bit of thinking done in AI safety strategy.
- Most of this thinking has been done by a small group of people we can identify.
- Much of this thinking is stored in the heads of this small group of people or in scattered threads on LessWrong and other discussion forums. The most basic insights have been written down in _Superintelligence_ and a few other summary documents, but there is still a lot that is not summarized.
- One insightful way to organize information is to take a standardized list of subtopics and record what a bunch of experts think about those subtopics.
