Some of this could fit in with the Quantified Self, as well as Digital Preservation/Link Rot. Perhaps there is a better name for this that can be merged later. Data is being stored at a faster rate than ways to analyze all this data, but in the future, smarter machine learning techniques will make this easier. 

this quote below (from https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-greatest-waste-of-human-potential/answer/John-Comley ) is also apt:

"The greatest waste of human potential is not transferring knowledge when people retire! WHAT A WASTE! All those years of knowledge and experience simply 'put out to pasture' when people retire!

I believe that people should be given a tax-break in their last 10 years of work if they can prove mentorship and knowledge transfer to newcomers. This would involve a managed program of sorts, but still I believe it is a travesty to see these people with years of experience and knowledge not passing it on."

AKC feels that this also happens with academia to a very large extent. Particularly when the best-taught courses are not archived (MOOCs are alleviating this, but this still has a long way to ago), and also when instructional methods have to be repeated between different students.
