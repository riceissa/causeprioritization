Some of this could fit in with the Quantified Self, as well as Digital Preservation/Link Rot. Perhaps there is a better name for this that can be merged later. Data is being stored at a faster rate than ways to analyze all this data, but in the future, smarter machine learning techniques will make this easier. 

this quote below (from <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-greatest-waste-of-human-potential/answer/John-Comley> ) is also apt:

> The greatest waste of human potential is not transferring knowledge when people retire! WHAT A WASTE! All those years of knowledge and experience simply 'put out to pasture' when people retire!
>
> I believe that people should be given a tax-break in their last 10 years of work if they can prove mentorship and knowledge transfer to newcomers. This would involve a managed program of sorts, but still I believe it is a travesty to see these people with years of experience and knowledge not passing it on.

AKC feels that this also happens with academia to a very large extent. Particularly when the best-taught courses are not archived (MOOCs are alleviating this, but this still has a long way to ago), and also when instructional methods have to be repeated between different students.

Also, people forget a shockingly high fraction of content they read, or "learn" from lecture (though this content is at least not permanently lost from the public domain). Most information communicated verbally is permanently lost and has little potential of being transmitted to other people.

In the far future, mind-uploading may be an answer (though one must also account the uncountable information one forgets as a child/teen/young adult)
