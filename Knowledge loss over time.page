Some of this could fit in with the Quantified Self, as well as Digital Preservation/Link Rot.

this quote below (from https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-greatest-waste-of-human-potential/answer/John-Comley ) is also apt:

"The greatest waste of human potential is not transferring knowledge when people retire! WHAT A WASTE! All those years of knowledge and experience simply 'put out to pasture' when people retire!

I believe that people should be given a tax-break in their last 10 years of work if they can prove mentorship and knowledge transfer to newcomers. This would involve a managed program of sorts, but still I believe it is a travesty to see these people with years of experience and knowledge not passing it on."
