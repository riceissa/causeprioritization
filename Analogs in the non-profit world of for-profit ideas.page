Several ideas from the for-profit world have ported over to the non-profit world.
This page discusses such analogs.

- [Moral trade]()
- [Broad market efficiency]()
- "[Altruistic arbitrage](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bk1/the_principle_of_altruistic_arbitrage/)"
- [Prospective versus retrospective funding](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153359058159228) (a Facebook post by Eliezer Yudkowsky about retrospective funding (which is standard for for-profits) for non-profits)

It's not clear how useful it is to consider these analogs individually or as a whole, but here are some points in favor^[The first two of these are essentially listed in Diego Caleiro's "[Introducing Moral Economics](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/ky/introducing_moral_economics/)", which does something similar: "The idea is to create the concept of a field of knowledge which associates these in a cluster, and understand the mechanics and logic that makes them related in concept space, as well as provides a vocabulary and perspective which allows us to discover other ideas which belong to the same cluster."]:

- Treating these analogs systematically will give greater coherence to people learning about these ideas for the first time.
- Assuming that some of the analogs of for-profit ideas turn out to be useful, looking at the for-profit world more systematically might turn up some "blind spots" in our thinking about the non-profit world.
- Inasmuch as [the ability to make money reflects social value](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Social_value_of_work:_income_as_a_proxy), it is useful to look to the for-profit world for better ways to do good.

There have been discussions of the broader for-profit vs non-profit distinction (without establishing an analog):

- "[Why Non-Profits?](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/why-non-profits.html)"
- "[Altruism and profit](http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/07/11/altruism-and-profit/)"
- "[Should altruists pay for profitable things?](https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/should-altruists-pay-for-profitable-things/)"
- "[Marginal Charity](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/marginal-charity.html)"
- It might be worth noting that GiveWell seems to pay attention to Y Combinator (even [emulating Y Combinator's "Requests for Startups"](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/)).
