In recent years several ideas from the for-profit world have ported over to the non-profit world.
This page discusses such analogs.

- [Moral trade]()
- [Broad market efficiency]()
- "[Altruistic arbitrage](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bk1/the_principle_of_altruistic_arbitrage/)"

It's not clear how useful it is to consider these analogs individually or as a whole, but here are some points in favor^[The first two of these are essentially listed in Diego Caleiro's "[Introducing Moral Economics](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/ky/introducing_moral_economics/)", which does something similar: "The idea is to create the concept of a field of knowledge which associates these in a cluster, and understand the mechanics and logic that makes them related in concept space, as well as provides a vocabulary and perspective which allows us to discover other ideas which belong to the same cluster."]:

- Treating these analogs systematically will give greater coherence to people learning about these ideas for the first time.
- Assuming that some of the analogs of for-profit ideas turn out to be useful, looking at the for-profit world more systematically might turn up some "blind spots" in our thinking about the non-profit world.
- Inasmuch as [ability to make money reflects social value](http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Social_value_of_work:_income_as_a_proxy), it is useful to look to the for-profit world for better ways to do good.
