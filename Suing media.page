Semi-serious cause area suggestion: making it legal to sue news companies for terrible articles.

Example: https://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/?utm_source=atlfb

Several obvious counters to the example:

1. News sites are bad at reporting truth. Claims are wildly over-exaggerated from what the study actually says. 

2. They still found the vegan diet to be *much* better than the standard American diet. Even if every claim in the article were true, given that other people eat so much meat/dairy, the land that "can't" be used by veganism is already being used, so veganism would still be the best way to have the most impact.

3. It's a single non-empirical study. Don't trust it too much.

4. Study has questionable assumptions, as you might expect. This is true of all single non-empirical studies, which is why you don't rely on a single one to form opinions. If I modeled students as studying hard one week before the exam (pretty reasonable), would it then be reasonable to conclude that college professors are irresponsible for not having exams every week?
