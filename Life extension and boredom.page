**Life extension and boredom** is an argument against life extension which states people whose lives are extended will repeat the same experience many times over, leading to a meaningless and boredom-filled existence.


Responding to this is for instance Ackerman[^ackerman]\ (pg 329):

[^ackerman]: "Death is a Punch in the Jaw: Life-extension and Its Discontents".
Felicia Nimue Ackerman.
*The Oxford Handbook of Bioethics*.
