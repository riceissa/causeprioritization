# Summary

One of the four focus areas as outlined by lukeprog [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/).

Some things to look into:

- What is the goal?
[This article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why) argues that "Animal activists should emphasize reduction, not elimination, of eating meat".

- How effective is it to try to convince people to become vegan/vegetarian?

- Can we/how do we compare animal suffering to human suffering, and what sort of rough dollar costs can we come up with for the cause?
See [Rough dollar estimates for the importance of various causes]() for more.
