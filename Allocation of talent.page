**Allocation of talent** is the matching of labor or skill with output or value,
so that people are working on what they individually can do most to produce
things of value.  In the context of a career, allocation of talent becomes the
problem of [Job selection](). Currently a lot of talent or skill seems to be
misallocated, in the sense that people are working on things that may not produce
a lot of value or that they're not good at.

In terms of cause prioritization, some questions to ask are:

- How badly is talent misallocated?
- Who is working on this problem? (What are some names under which this same idea
  is known?)
