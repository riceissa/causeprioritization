A few months ago, while researching scenario analysis, I came across an
acronym called PESTEL.
PESTEL stands for political, economic, social,
technological, environmental, and legal. Broadly,these are the different
dimensions we need to consider when evaluating different scenarios
(another source I read talked of the STEEP framework, that omitted
"legal" from the list, presumably because of its overlap with the
political dimension).

Causes typically considered in EA contexts fare quite differently with
respect to the dimensions where they involve the most change, and to
effectively prioritize between causes, we need to have a general
understanding of just how tractable each dimension of change is.

**The easy case: the causes where the limiting factor is money**

The causes that are simplest to understand are those where a proven
approach simply needs to be scaled up, and the main constraint is money.
We have a relatively clear idea of how additional money would translate
to results on the ground. No significant changes are necessary on any of
the PESTEL dimensions (though even these simple
interventions may have ripple effects on these other dimensions over the
longer term). GiveWell's current and former top-rated charities, such as
GiveDirectly, Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control
Initiative, fit this description, at least as they are typically
described: there is a proven (or semi-proven) intervention with a
roughly determined bang for the buck, so if more money flows to the
intervention, more stuff will be accomplished.

In this post, I will ignore the "easy cases". Of course, to obtain a
satisfactory answer to the cause prioritization question on the whole,
we would need to compare the easy cases with the harder cases. But I
want to begin by simply evaluating the harder cases. A lot has been
written (particularly by GiveWell) on the evaluation of easy cases, so
it makes sense to focus on the harder cases.

**The Importance, Neglectedness, Tractability (INT) framework**

In comments on the EA open thread, people have talked about three
criteria for cause evaluation:

-   Importance
-   Neglectedness
-   Tractability

While importance, neglectedness, and tractability vary by cause, this
post talks more about how the INT framework interacts in general with
the PESTEL framework. Can we say anything in
general about whether causes that require mostly political change are
more likely to be important or neglected than causes that require mostly
technological change? Can we say about about whether causes that focus
on economic change are more tractable than those that focus on legal
change? A general INT X PESTEL analysis can
offer good Bayesian priors for our investigations of particular causes.

**The political and legal dimensions**

I'm clubbing the political and legal together, even though there are
important differences: many legal changes can be accomplished through
non-political channels (case law and judicial precedent can occur
independently of "politics" as it's usually conceived), and many
"political" changes may not operate through any formal changes to the
legal framework. Nonetheless, the main reason we care about political
change is that politics is the mechanism through which laws are decided.

Some examples of big policy changes that have been considered
high-potential from the EA perspective, grouped by category:

-   Libertarian/globalization: Migration policy (the extreme being open
    borders), trade policy (the extreme being free trade)
-   Libertarian/basic economic freedom: Getting governments around the
    world to the level of economic freedom seen in relatively
    economically free countries, such as the US and Canada.
-   Libertarian/libertine: Allowing markets in products that might be
    high-value to trade, such as human organs and tissues. Also,
    allowing trade that may not be intrinsically high-value, but where
    the crackdown is (believed to be) very socially and economically
    destructive. Examples here might be drug legalization and allowing
    prostitution.
-   Intellectual property: Various directions of IP reform have been
    considered, generally in the direction of making copyright, patent,
    and trademark law less stringent. The main social value
    justification is with respect to patent law in drug discovery,
    though patents might also have an impact on innovation in the
    software world.

There are "spending"-type policy changes, that mainly involve
influencing how governments allocate money:

-   Foreign aid: The idea is to lobby governments of better-off
    countries to spend more on foreign aid, specifically on the most
    high-value components of foreign aid.
-   Technological investment: Lobbying governments to spend more (or
    less) on particular forms of technology.
-   Intranational stuff: Most of this isn't promising from the EA
    perspective directly, but it could be based on flow-through effects.
    For instance, perhaps socialized universal health care and/or a
    radical free market in health care could deliver huge social value,
    both directly and through the increased wealth and technological
    progress it enables. Perhaps a more robust social safety net could
    also have strong flow-through effects.
