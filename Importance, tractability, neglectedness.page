**Importance, tractability, neglectedness** have become standard metrics for assessing causes.
See for instance [80,000 Hours' post](https://80000hours.org/2014/01/which-cause-is-most-effective-300) and [this comment](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7m/open_thread/hs) on the EA Forum.

Note that sometimes "importance" is referred to as how "valuable" a cause is, and "neglectedness" is described as "uncrowdedness".
