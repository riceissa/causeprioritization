It seems that many people are very wasteful about their money (while not being attentive enough about what they're sacrificing in order to earn that money). 

Some examples: fancy restaurants, coffee (people waste several dollars a day on this!! when caffeine/modafinil pills can do the same thing at much cheaper prices)
