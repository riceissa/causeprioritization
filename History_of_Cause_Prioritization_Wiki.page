|2014-11-28|The Git repository of the wiki has its initial commit on this day, and the domains are registered on this day.|
|2015-12-27|Issa privately announces hiatus on CP wiki work.|
|2016-04|Issa begins full-time work for Vipul Naik. While the work is not explicitly about cause prioritization (rather, initially it is about global health), the work would help Issa explore various cause areas and movements.|
|2017-03-12|[Timelines Wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Main_Page) is created, using as seed material timelines from Wikipedia (mainly those whose creation was funded by Vipul Naik). Timelines Wiki serves as a useful place to get an understanding of the main flow of various causes and movements (although the wiki isn't limited to timelines on such topics).|
|2018-02-16|Issa figures out how to modify the Gitit codebase and changes wikilinks to use underscores instead of spaces and to capitalize the first letter. Pages begin to be renamed to use underscores.|
