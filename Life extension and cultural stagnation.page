**Life extension and cultural stagnation** is the idea that, once the old generation continues to live, their old ideas will continue to live too, leading to a lack of progress in culture, ideas, etc.

> Curing aging would mean the current human culture would be predominant because older persons would never retire, probably would hardly change their ideas, and would block the way to the younger, fresh ideologies. Culturally, or memetically, humankind has been evolving at an astonishing pace. If we compare human society 1,000 years ago with our society now we see an extraordinary cultural evolution in various concepts and even in ethics (e.g., slavery and racism were widely accepted not too long ago in human history). In [spite] of the fact that someone brilliant at his/her job would be able to continue at it forever, to have a generation of men and women without cultural progress could be a catastrophe for humankind.

A slightly different take by Anne Corwin on "[Superlongevity, Stagnation, and Posthuman Potential](http://www.existenceiswonderful.com/2006/05/superlongevity-stagnation-and.html)", which argues that as people stop dying, "biological evolution" will stop, but cultural evolution will continue; i.e. evolution will "occur through creative means that are nonbiological in nature".
This is the opposite of de Magalhaes, who says that genetic evolution can continue through genetic engineering (see quote above), but that cultural progress may stop.
So what about the concern for stagnation cited by de Magalhaes?
Corwin argues that "It makes little sense to place arbitrary limits on the brains of posthumans in terms of the ability of these brains to enjoy a degree of plasticity and flexibility often considered the exclusive province of the young and new."
