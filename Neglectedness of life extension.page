João Pedro de Magalhães has created the "Who's Who in Gerontology", which lists people and companies working on aging research around the world.
For instance, as of 2014-02-04, the site lists [23 companies](http://whoswho.senescence.info/companies.php) and [284 researchers](http://whoswho.senescence.info/people.php).

Some questions to ask are:

- Are the numbers given above a lot for this type of research?

- How many people are working on other areas of biomedical research? ---In other words, is the number of people working on anti-aging a lot relative to these similar areas?

- Are the numbers large or small compared to dissimilar fields in academia or other completely unrelated causes?
