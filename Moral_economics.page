Moral economics is the application of economics principles to altruistic endeavors.

Moral economics includes incentive mechanisms and coordination mechanisms.

Incentive mechanisms include certificates of impact and [impact prizes](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2cCDhxmG36m3ybYbq/impact-prizes-as-an-alternative-to-certificates-of-impact).

Coordination mechanisms include [moral trades](http://www.amirrorclear.net/files/moral-trade.pdf) and [donation swaps](https://donationswap.eahub.org/).

# Certificate of impact
[Certificates of impact](https://rationalaltruist.com/2014/11/15/certificates-of-impact/) were proposed by Paul Christiano in 2014. Benjamin Ross Hoffman proposed a [minimum viable product](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/minimum-viable-impact-purchases/) for this idea. This website on [impact purchases](https://impactpurchase.org/) explores this idea in more depth and purchased some certificate in 2015.
