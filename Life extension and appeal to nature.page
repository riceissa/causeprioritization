The **argument against life extension based on an appeal to nature** states that it is wrong to extend life because it is not natural.

See for instance "[Radical Life Extension Is Already Here, But We're Doing it Wrong](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/05/radical-life-extension-is-already-here-but-were-doing-it-wrong/257383/)":

> But there is another, deeper argument against life extension---the
> argument from evolution. Its proponents suggest that we ought to avoid
> tinkering with *any* human trait borne of natural selection. Doing so,
> they argue, could have unforeseen consequences, especially given that
> natural selection has such a sterling engineering track record. If our
> bodies grow old and die, the thinking goes, then there must be a good
> reason, even if we don't understand it yet.
