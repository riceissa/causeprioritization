# Quotes from "Panel Musings on AI"

From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA4vW4oQavk&index=24&list=PLwp9xeoX5p8NnWYsybl_ZRMtaK7uBr4sN):

Starting around 19:20. On whether he is more concerned about developing advanced AI or *not*
developing advanced AI.

> I think I'm deeply concerned about both. So you know on the not
> developing advanced AI, one observation you can make is that modern
> society and particularly society with nuclear weapons has only been
> around for about seventy years. There have been a lot of close calls since
> then and things seem to be getting worse. If I look at kind
> of the world and geopolitics in the last in the last few years
> China's rising, there's a lot of unrest in the Western world, a
> lot of very destructive nationalism, we're developing biological
> technologies very quickly. It's not entirely clear to me that civilization is
> compatible with digital communication. It has really some subtle
> corrosive effects. So every year that passes is a danger that we
> face and although AI has a number of dangers actually I think if we
> never built AI, if we don't build AI for 100 years or 200 years,
> I'm very worried about whether civilization will actually survive. Of
> course on the other hand I mean I work on AI safety, and so
> I'm very concerned that transformative AI is very powerful
> and that bad things could happen either because of safety or alignment
> problems or because there's a concentration of power in the hands of
> the wrong people, the wrong governments, who control AI. So I think
> it's terrifying in all directions but not building AI isn't an option because
> I don't think civilization is safe.

Starting around 29:10:

> So from the EA community in particular -- I mean I think there's a lot
> of things the EA community gets right about AI that no one else gets
> right. But one thing that I'd like to see less of is that there's a
> particular model I often see from -- not all but some -- people
> in EA which is sort of that there's like two progress bars and one
> of them is the AI capabilities progress bar and the other is
> the AI safety progress bar, and if the AI capabilities progress bar
> reaches the end before the AI safety progress bar then we all die,
> and if the AI safety progress bar reaches the end first then it's
> great. I think this model is kind of dangerous because I think it's
> inaccurate and it really drives the impression among AI researchers that AI
> safety people think their work is evil or trying to hold back their
> work, and I think that actually does push against acceptance.
>
> The reason I
> think it's not right is that at least in my own experience a lot
> of the safety work I do is made possible by recent advances in
> capabilities work. A lot of the safety work I do also allows you to
> do capabilities work in different ways that's maybe
> safety-compatible. I also think that relating to AGI in particular
> some of the safety work that we end up doing with respect to AGI,
> a lot of it may only be possible within the last two or three
> years before AGI. So there's a lot of intertwinement between these two
> things and while it's true that I think that we should work on
> safety research right away -- we shouldn't wait until when we're gonna build
> AGI tomorrow -- and that's why I'm working on it now, I
> think we should maybe be less extreme and chill a little bit about
> being scared about the next breakthrough in capabilities.
> It's possible that we will have a hard time doing all the safety
> research at the end but there's actually a limited amount that we may be able to
> do early on. So the situation is just not as binary, and I think that frame
> polarizes AI researchers against AI safety researchers and I
> think that's unhelpful.

Starting around 35:30:

> So here's a one-liner: AI doesn't have to learn all of human
> morality. So this is something actually that even at this point MIRI
> agrees with but there's some writing in the past -- a lot of writing
> in the past -- that I think people are still anchored to in many
> ways. So what I mean by that in particular is that I think the things
> we would want from an AGI are to kind of stabilize the world, to end
> material scarcity, to give us control over our own biology, maybe to
> resolve international conflicts. We don't want or I think need to
> kind of build a system -- at least not build a system ourselves -- that
> kind of is a sovereign and kind of runs the world for the indefinite
> future and controls the entire light cone. So of course you still
> need to know a lot of things about human values but I still often
> run into people who are kind of thinking about this problem in a way that I
> think is actually harder than we probably need to solve.

Starting around 39:30:

> So first of all I don't know. The problem could be really easy, it
> could be really hard. That's a reason to work on it early. I am
> relatively optimistic, though no one should take this as a reason to
> stop caring about AI safety. Even if there were only a 5% risk that
> something catastrophic would happen to the world because of it, that
> would be well worth much more effort than the world is putting into
> it. The effort of all the people in this room and many others it's still just
> ridiculously under-allocated.
>
> That said, two reasons I might have
> for believing that it might not be all that hard. The first is the
> one I just said before that I think we may not need to learn
> all of human morality and build a sovereign and basically build something that decides
> what
> the best way to set up human society is. That problem sounds really hard. We
> may just need to build artefacts that perform particular engineering
> tasks for us in order to put the world in a better place. Now
> they're very hard engineering tasks that we don't currently know how
> to do until -- the problem is still hard because you may still have to do large searches over difficult strategies. But it's not nearly as
> hard as if you look at the early writings of MIRI. MIRI ten years
> ago, people suspected that it would be.
>
> So that's one thing and the
> second thing is I would point out a lot about the meta-learning
> thing I said before where a lot of the time we're finding that it's
> often more efficient rather than developing an algorithm to understand how
> something works in a fundamental philosophical sense, often that is
> impossible or maybe there *is* no fundamentally best algorithm for doing
> something. So I often suspect this about decision theories, where
> there's a bunch of different decision theories that each has
> different pluses and minuses and people argue about the merits of
> them and think about ways that catastrophic things could happen
> depending on which decision theory you use, and I think a possible way
> around this is just have an AI learn these concepts and maybe the
> concepts are inherently fuzzy, just like it took neural nets to tell
> the difference between objects when the differences between those
> objects are inherently fuzzy. We may be able to learn safety
> concepts that way and a lot of the concerns about safety are where
> there are all these edge cases: how do we make a thing
> that makes paper clips? And strangely it may actually be the case that
> not trying to solve the problem directly and taking one step of
> abstraction up may allow us to solve it. At the same time, there are
> still worries that we may not have enough of that kind of data. We
> may not have the right models to do it. So even if that's right, then
> there's still many ways in which we could have systems that are very
> capable but that manage to be dangerous in ways that we can't easily
> detect. So I don't really know for sure but those are some reasons
> for optimism at least.

Starting around 44:20:

> So I work with Paul Christiano and he's probably about as
> pessimistic or optimistic as I am and probably for similar reasons.
> I don't have exact answers here but we've talked a lot and we have
> similar views on what will be hard and what won't be hard and his
> agenda kind of states things in a different way but I think one of
> his themes is similar to the thing I said which is he wrote a post about
> corrigibility in particular where's it's like there's all these
> paradoxes with if you try algorithms for corrigibility and maybe it
> isn't that hard to learn the concept "corrigibility" and learn the
> concept of "honesty" and these are fuzzy concepts and so if you kind of try and
> define them to a rule-based system or very simple machine learning system they don't
> make a lot of sense but neither do other advanced non-safety-related
> concepts. That said, to give an object-level argument about why
> things might be hard and kind of not contradict but supplement what
> I said before, people talk a lot about value alignment and learning
> right objective functions. I think we're just gonna have a lot of very
> mundane problems with, you're developing a self-driving car and the
> training data differs from the test data, you put it in the real
> world, it doesn't do the right thing and if it screws up it kills
> someone. With very powerful AI, if you're trying to make
> breakthroughs in biology, if you're trying to resolve international
> conflict, messing up could kill a lot of people. I can even think of
> scenarios where it could kill everyone. And there's probably a lot
> of those scenarios will be dealing with very new technologies. To
> me that's one way that catastrophe could happen.
