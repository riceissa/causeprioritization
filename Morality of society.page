This cause takes on many different terms, probably because there is not yet a standard term: "improving the morality of society", "getting people to be nicer", "expanding the moral circle", "getting society to be more reflective", etc.

Most online articles in the effective altruism community only treat this subject as an aside; this could mean that the subject is hard to reason about, or that it has been investigated insufficiently.
