Questions:

- Historically, how have new biomedical treatments been distributed? 
    - What was the delay for e.g. the poor, less developed countries in receiving treatment?
    - What does the distribution currently look like for treatments that have been around for a while?
    - What is the distribution like as a function of e.g. the cost, the importance (how life-threatening is it?) of the treatment?

- Given the answers to the above, what can we say about the distribution of life extension treatments?
