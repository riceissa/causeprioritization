- [Review of Small and Medium Enterprise Support in the Developing World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/105PxVPp8f66t86COessVFpxIofxWAfCyqpUbW44jL_4/edit#heading=h.os8qh4xjurfb)

    > A brief literature review was performed to determine whether there is evidence that support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) helps create jobs for poor people, or otherwise reduces poverty in the developing world. Based on this literature review, there does not seem to be solid evidence that support to the SME sector helps create jobs for poor people, or helps reduce poverty.
