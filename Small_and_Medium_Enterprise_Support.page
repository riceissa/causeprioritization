- [Review of Small and Medium Enterprise Support in the Developing World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/105PxVPp8f66t86COessVFpxIofxWAfCyqpUbW44jL_4/edit#heading=h.os8qh4xjurfb)

    > A brief literature review was performed to determine whether there is evidence that support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) helps create jobs for poor people, or otherwise reduces poverty in the developing world. The review was performed by a member of the Effective Altruism Quebec community to advise anonymous donors wishing to help relieve extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on this literature review, there does not seem to be solid evidence that support to the SME sector helps create jobs for poor people, or helps reduce poverty. Therefore it was recommended that the donors not allocate funds to this cause area based on their objectives and current evidence.
