Some thoughts:

- Focus on shallow investigations?---"breadth first" vs "depth first"
- Final form a wiki? What about a blog? Or something else entirely?
- How to look at causes?
    - [Importance, tractability, neglectedness]()? or, more generally, [General questions for causes]()
    - A single number for each cause/a ranking?
    - Separate rankings for each "cluster" of causes (e.g. existential risks, global health [which is what GW has done], biomedical research, and so on)
    - Have a separate ranking for each "type of action/intervention" (e.g. cause A is best if you want to give money, cause B is best if you want to volunteer, cause C is best if you want to do academic research, etc.)?
    - Cluster thinking/sequence thinking applied to causes?
    - Look at Owen Cotton-Barrat's approach to modeling.
    - PESTEL framework, or PESTEL x INT framework, so things like "do things under politics tend to be tractable?", etc.
- What to optimize for?
  Examples:
    - For the cause that has the best potential for online advocacy a la Open Borders?
      This was sort of the implicit original plan, in that I wanted to figure out what cause I should make a website for.
    - Finding what the best causes are, period: treating CP as an end-goal instead of as a means to figure out what to do next.
- How best to communicate comparisons?
  Examples:
    - A table on wikis, e.g. Cognito Mentoring wiki likes to use tables for comparisons: <http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Lower_division_undergraduate_mathematics_course_structure>.
      See also Groupprops, with pages like <http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_group:S3>
      There are also things like WikiMatrix, e.g. [here](http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/gitit+MediaWiki) that let you compare two things along different parameters, though causes may be too dissimilar for this to work nicely.
    - A series of blog posts might be another answer.
    - A web of interconnected wiki pages, which seems to be the current default trajectory.
- Creating some sort of community around CP itself...
    - Almost like an "organic" version of the Open Philanthropy Project (GW Labs), where anyone can [Be Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold) and add to something, instead of all the research coming from one place (how to ensure quality?)
