Some thoughts:

- Focus on shallow investigations?---"breadth first" vs "depth first"
- Final form a wiki? What about a blog? Or something else entirely?
- How to look at causes?
    - [Importance, tractability, neglectedness]()? or, more generally, [General questions for causes]()
    - A single number for each cause/a ranking?
    - Separate rankings for each "cluster" of causes (e.g. existential risks, global health [which is what GW has done], biomedical research, and so on)
    - Have a separate ranking for each "type of action/intervention" (e.g. cause A is best if you want to give money, cause B is best if you want to volunteer, cause C is best if you want to do academic research, etc.)?
    - Cluster thinking/sequence thinking applied to causes?
    - Look at Owen Cotton-Barrat's approach to modeling.
    - [PESTEL framework](), or PESTEL x INT framework, so things like "do things under politics tend to be tractable?", etc.
    - One can also split causes into those that are controversial, and those that aren't (or have a gradient).
    If a cause is controversial, it's important first to actually establish that it's something worth working on (because putting effort into something that's likely to cause harm is wasteful), so the format for those pages might take on a "pros and cons" sort of thing.
    If a cause is already considered good (and no one really thinks it's bad) then this "pros and cons" doesn't make sense; we just want to know how big of a deal the cause is.

- What to optimize for?
  Examples:
    - For the cause that has the best potential for online advocacy a la Open Borders?
      This was sort of the implicit original plan, in that I wanted to figure out what cause I should make a website for.
    - Finding what the best causes are, period: treating CP as an end-goal instead of as a means to figure out what to do next.
- How best to communicate comparisons?
  Examples:
    - A table on wikis, e.g. Cognito Mentoring wiki likes to use tables for comparisons: <http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Lower_division_undergraduate_mathematics_course_structure>.
      See also Groupprops, with pages like <http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_group:S3>
      There are also things like WikiMatrix, e.g. [here](http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/gitit+MediaWiki) that let you compare two things along different parameters, though causes may be too dissimilar for this to work nicely.
    - A series of blog posts might be another answer.
    - A web of interconnected wiki pages, which seems to be the current default trajectory.
- Creating some sort of community around CP itself...
    - Almost like an "organic" version of the Open Philanthropy Project (GW Labs), where anyone can [Be Bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold) and add to something, instead of all the research coming from one place (how to ensure quality?)
