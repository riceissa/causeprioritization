**Curbing cultural output** is an idea put forth by gwern in "[Culture is not about Esthetics](http://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics)".
Essentially, there may be too many movies, music, fiction books, and so on that people cannot possibly consume all of these.
Since people prefer the best of cultural output, and since it's much easier to locate these within older works, newer cultural output may be "unnecessary".
