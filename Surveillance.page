Nick Bostrom in "[Existential Risks](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)":

> Other technologies that have a wide range of risk-reducing potential include intelligence augmentation, information technology, and surveillance. These can make us smarter individually and collectively, and can make it more feasible to enforce necessary regulation. A strong prima facie case therefore exists for pursuing these technologies as vigorously as possible.

In a footnote:

> In the case of surveillance, it seems important to aim for the two-way transparency advocated by David Brin [...], where we all can watch the agencies that watch us.

However Michael Huemer notes that there is no incentive currently to monitor
the government (§9.4.4 of *The Problem of Political Authority*):

> But no one will become passionate about monitoring a thousandth of the daily activities of government. To propose that the general public voluntarily sacrifice large portions of their lives to the task of studying such tedious matters as the provisions of the latest farm bill, all so that each can have a microscopic chance of improving a microscopic fraction of government policies, is at least as utopian as proposing that we all simply agree henceforth to work selflessly for the good of society.
