Nick Bostrom in "[Existential Risks](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)":

> Other technologies that have a wide range of risk-reducing potential include intelligence augmentation, information technology, and surveillance. These can make us smarter individually and collectively, and can make it more feasible to enforce necessary regulation. A strong prima facie case therefore exists for pursuing these technologies as vigorously as possible.

Consider also e.g. the [speakularity](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/09/seeing-the-speakularity.html).

In a footnote:

> In the case of surveillance, it seems important to aim for the two-way transparency advocated by David Brin [...], where we all can watch the agencies that watch us.
