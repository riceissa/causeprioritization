**Philosophical progress** seems like (1) a cause area; (2) relevant to multiple
specific cause areas; and (3) a part of [cause prioritization]().

Answers to philosophy questions have implications for altruism (see e.g. the work of MIRI and [Foundational Research Institute]()) and for specific cause areas (like [AI alignment]()).

For cause prioritization, answers to questions like how we discover our values or which beings count for moral consideration are relevant to deciding which causes to support. See e.g. [this post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-and-philosophical-questions-might-affect-our-grantmaking "“Technical and Philosophical Questions That Might Affect Our Grantmaking”. Open Philanthropy Project. April 7, 2017. Retrieved February 21, 2018.").
