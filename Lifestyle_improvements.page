This is an umbrella-cause for things like improving diet, exercise, sleep apnea/CPAP machines, various ergonomic improvements, etc.
I think this cause tends to be tacitly assumed to be worthwhile, in the sense that people believe *they personally* need to improve in these dimensions, but I'm uncertain whether it gets much serious coverage as a cause.
There is for instance CFAR, which tackles the even broader problem of improving rationality.

There is a lot of noise in this area so even if good interventions
can be found, can they compete with fake interventions that are
optimized for sales or spreading?
