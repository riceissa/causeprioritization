This is an umbrella-cause for things like improving diet, exercise, sleep apnea/CPAP machines, various ergonomic improvements, etc.
I think this cause tends to be tacitly assumed to be worthwhile, in the sense that people believe *they personally* need to improve in these dimensions, but I'm uncertain whether it gets much serious coverage as a cause.
There is for instance CFAR, which tackles the even broader problem of improving rationality.
