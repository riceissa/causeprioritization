**Romance**, in the context of a cause, refers to the problem of finding
good ways to match people with others who are romantically compatible.
It also refers to the more general problem of helping people enter and
stay in happy romantic relationships.

# What is the problem?

- Current means of finding romantic partners seem astoundingly
  inefficient.[^pua] Even online dating sites like OKCupid probably have
  low-hanging fruit for improvement.  It would be nice if better ways of
  finding partners could emerge.

- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a
  relationship/married.  See for instance [rates of divorce in the US]:
  "the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%".

  [rates of divorce in the US]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_divorce

    Also, OkCupid is officially 18+. While there are definitely people
    below 18 on it, there probably aren't many under 18 who extensively
    utilize it.


# Importance

Given how fundamental romance seems to be among humans and how unhappy
people seem to be when their romantic needs go unmet, it seems like
there is a good case to be made for the importance of romance as a
cause.

# Tractability

Given that many people are in happy relationships, the problem is
clearly tractable for some people. It's unclear how tractable this
problem is in full generality. In particular, it seems difficult to
estimate how many more people can be placed in happy relationships given
certain interventions.

# Neglectedness

While there seem to be various books (especially pop science and
self-help books) written on the subject of romance, as well as various
online communities dedicated to helping people meet their romantic needs
(e.g. the pick-up artistry movement), romance doesn't seem to be thought
of as a cause to focus on, in the sense that e.g.  life extension or
existential risk or climate change are thought of as causes.  Approaches
to solving this problem seem rather disparate at the moment, where e.g.
each author of a book advocates their own preferred approach (which may
or may not work for others). In other words, there seems to be a lack of
concerted effort at seriously trying to solve this problem.

More recently, there have been various attempts to solve the matching
problem in romance through online dating sites (e.g. OkCupid) and
various apps (most notorious perhaps is Tinder). However it's unclear
how successful these have been.

# The future of dating

One possibility for "solving" the problem of romance is to look at how
dating has evolved over the years, and to try to locate and fund
promising future forms of dating. Even now, online dating has changed
some aspects of how people date. For instance Schaeffer-Grabiel
[writes][schaeffer] in *Love and Empire: Cybermarriage and Citizenship
across the Americas* about the experiences of US men in finding women in
Central and South America:

[schaeffer]: https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780814724927/9780814724927-7.pdf

> Computers have dramatically altered the process and places of dating,
> facilitating quick and accessible forums for men to communicate
> virtually with women in other countries as well as with each other. As
> I followed men in their search for a bride, it was not only their
> desire for a Latina that interested me but the pleasure they found
> discussing their experiences and perspectives with other like-minded
> men in chat rooms—a process that had not existed in previous
> mail-order bride exchanges

Robert Epstein also talks about "controlling" love (see below). Future
machine learning technology could also make assessing compatibility much
easier, and virtual dating might become popular (see below for this as
well).

    The article mainly talks about how people are very deceptive in how
    they portray themselves in online dating profiles, lying about age,
    weight, income, etc. Not too surprising.
    The article also talks the future of dating. It mentions making
    online dating more "community"-oriented, by bringing friends and
    family into the picture:

    > Engage, for example, allows members to bring friends and family
    > with them online, all of whom can prowl the profiles, checking
    > people out and matching them up. Members can also rate the
    > politeness of their dates, as well as the accuracy of the
    > profiles. This is the new “community” approach to online
    > matching—a naturalistic, social corrective for the deception that
    > plagues cyberspace.

    It also mentions virtual dating:

    > Using special software developed by the M.I.T. Media Lab,
    > researchers Frost, Ariely and Harvard University’s Michael I.
    > Norton recently reported that people who had had a chance to
    > interact with each other (by computer only) on a virtual tour of a
    > museum subsequently had more successful face-to-face meetings than
    > people who had viewed only profiles. One major bonus: virtual
    > dating takes care of the safety concerns that prevent many people
    > from meeting in person.
    >

    > in a romantic virtual cafe on the Champs-Élysées in Paris—seeing
    > and hearing each other online as they interact in this beautiful
    > setting. Andrew Fiore, a doctoral candidate at the University of
    > California, Berkeley, who studies online dating, suggests that in
    > a few years we will even be able to add physiological signs to the
    > experience—the sound of your date’s heartbeat, perhaps?
