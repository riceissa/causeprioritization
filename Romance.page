**Romance**, as a cause, refers to a collection of interventions that
affect how people date, marry, and otherwise interact romantically. In
particular, interventions try to help people enter and stay in happy
romantic relationships.  Note that although not strictly included under
romance, some non-romantic forms of love (e.g. erotic love) are often
discussed alongside romance.

The basic idea is that current means of finding romantic partners seem
astoundingly inefficient.[^pua] Even popular online dating sites like
OkCupid probably have low-hanging fruit for improvement.  It would be
nice if better ways of finding partners who are romantically compatible could emerge.

However, as with all controversial causes, it is important to evaluate
to what extent "more and better romance" is a good thing.  In other
words, in investigating the [importance](#importance) of romance, one
must first establish the sign (positive or negative) of the impact of
intervening in people's romantic pursuits.

# Upshot/Executive summary

Following a brief investigation of romance as a potential cause, it
seems unlikely that romance is a particularly good cause to invest much
in (in terms of money, efforts to invervene, etc.). Moreover, more
detailed research into romance is unlikely to overturn this impression
(though it could still lead to deeper insights).

- [something about importance] ([More](#importance))
- tractability
- neglectedness

# Importance

Given how fundamental romance seems to be among humans and how unhappy
people seem to be when their romantic needs go unmet, it seems like
there is a good case to be made for the importance of romance as a
cause.


- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a
  relationship/married.  See for instance [rates of divorce in the US]:
  "the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%".

  [rates of divorce in the US]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_divorce


However in terms of happiness economics, [relationships] seem to only be
a part of what determines happiness, and in particular affecting income
is probably a more straightforward way to increase happiness
(particularly for very low-income individuals).

[relationships]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness_economics#Relationships_and_children

# Tractability

Given that many people are in happy relationships, romance isn't an
impossible problem (at least for many people). This situation is unlike
many technological causes, where it is unclear whether the technology in
question can even be realized. For the most part, romance is also unlike
advocacy causes (like [Open borders]()), which require changes in
legislation; instead, romance can be approached at a much more local
level. Nevertheless, it is unclear how tractable this problem is in full
generality. In particular, it seems difficult to estimate how many more
people can be placed in happy relationships given certain interventions.

Paul Graham, venture capitalist and co-founder of Y Combinator, [wrote
in 2005][pg dating]:

[pg dating]: http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html

> For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did
> before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to

It is important to note that this was only a year after the launch of
OkCupid, and indeed in the years since 2005, many more dating services
have become available (see [Timeline of technology-assisted dating
services]() for the full chronology). Indeed, since the late 1950s there
has been a steady stream of dating services that have tried to help with
the matching process. The fact that the problem of romance is still very
much real attests the difficulty of solving it.

# Neglectedness

Numerous interventions have been attempted to increase the number or
quality of romantic matches. In the for-profit world, a number of
companies have tried to match people using technology; many of these are
listen in the [Timeline of technology-assisted dating services](). In
addition, at least the governments of Japan[^j govt] and
[Singapore][sdn] have in some form tried to intervene in the romantic
lives of its citizens.

[^j govt]: See for instance the BBC's "[Japan: Speed-dating plan to boost
dwindling birth rate][j bbc]" and The Japan Times' "[Government to
support matchmaking, men’s child-rearing to raise birthrate][jt d]".

[j bbc]: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-31869981
[jt d]: http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/13/national/social-issues/government-to-support-matchmaking-mens-child-rearing-to-raise-birthrate/
[sdn]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Development_Network

In terms of discussion of romance, while there seem to be various books
(especially pop science and self-help books) written on the subject of
romance, as well as various online communities dedicated to helping
people meet their romantic needs (e.g. the pick-up artistry movement),
romance doesn't seem to be thought of as a cause to focus on, in the
sense that e.g. life extension or existential risk or climate change are
thought of as causes. In other words, while interventions focusing on
romance are numerous, there isn't a seriousness about romance as a
cause. Approaches to solving this problem seem rather disparate at the
moment, where e.g.  each author of a book advocates their own preferred
approach (which may or may not work for others), or else each dating
service tries to appeal to its niche audience. In other words, there
seems to be a lack of concerted effort at seriously trying to solve this
problem.

# The future of dating

One possibility for "solving" the problem of romance is to look at how
dating has evolved over the years, and to try to locate and fund
promising future forms of dating. Even now, online dating has changed
some aspects of how people date. For instance Schaeffer-Grabiel
[writes][schaeffer] in *Love and Empire: Cybermarriage and Citizenship
across the Americas* about the experiences of US men in finding women in
Central and South America:

[schaeffer]: https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780814724927/9780814724927-7.pdf

> Computers have dramatically altered the process and places of dating,
> facilitating quick and accessible forums for men to communicate
> virtually with women in other countries as well as with each other. As
> I followed men in their search for a bride, it was not only their
> desire for a Latina that interested me but the pleasure they found
> discussing their experiences and perspectives with other like-minded
> men in chat rooms—a process that had not existed in previous
> mail-order bride exchanges

Robert Epstein also talks about "controlling" love (see below). Future
machine learning technology could also make assessing compatibility much
easier, and virtual dating might become popular (see below for this as
well).

One of the primary difficulties with addressing the problem of romance
is the fact that the probability that two randomly selected members of
the population will be romantically compatible is low. The vast majority
of conceivable ways to address this problem, including existing attempts
(such as dances and dating websites like OkCupid),  have an
effectiveness that increases approximately logistically as the
proportion of the population that uses them increases^[why?]^, but the
aforementioned low probability means that the inflection point on the
graph of effectiveness vs. proportion of population using them is
located at a relatively high percentage of the population---certainly one
that is likely to intuitively be much greater than the current
proportion of the population which uses OkCupid, for instance. In fact,
fragmentation of matchmaking services hurts the effectiveness of all of
them for a host of reasons, some of which have negative feedback
effects.

The natural conclusion is that centralization of these efforts, and in
particular the existence of simply one large service for matchmaking, is
likely to be optimal.

On the other hand, havin niche dating sites might make it more likely
for certain people to engage in online dating.

(This "one general dating site" vs "a bunch of niche dating sites"
difference sort of resembles the difference between e.g. Quora and Stack
Exchange.)

# Intersection with other causes

One reason romance as a cause might be more important than one might
first think given its unspectacular performance in the usual metrics (in
particular [Importance, tractability, neglectedness]()) is its
intersection with other causes. In particular:

- The intersection of romance and [Open borders]() yields [transnational
  marriages][tr ma].[^marr]

    [tr ma]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnational_marriage

- The intersection of romance and more advanced [Quantified self]() and
  computer algorithms yields more insights in the matching problem,
  which can then lead to better matches (in terms of efficiency,
  compatibility).  Online dating in particular is also connected to
  [social change](Large-scale social movements) in general (and in
  particular has changed how people think about dating, e.g. how scarce
  they perceive their dating pool to be[^scarcity]).

- The intersection of romance and advancements in hardware yields for
  instance [haptic technology to allow more realistic virtual sex][r
  sex] (e.g. for those in long-distance relationships, or those not in
  relationships).

    [r sex]: http://kinkandcode.com/haptic-technology-and-romance/

In other words, romance provides a "lens" through which to reason about
these other causes.  One way to put it is that if these other causes are
sufficiently good, then we will end up looking at where these causes
intersect with romance anyway.  And focusing specifically on the romance
aspect of each cause might provide a deeper understanding.

[^scarcity]: Dan Slater writes in *A Million First Dates*:

    > For virtually all of human history the search for a mate has been
    > predicated on scarcity: One met only so many people in his or her
    > lifetime. They optimized their options within a circumscribed
    > pool, chose someone, settled down, and, in the best of cases,
    > found something they called happiness. Even when women’s lib came
    > along, and the legal and cultural restraints surrounding divorce
    > began to ease in the 1960s and 1970s, making it easier to leave
    > failed relationships, many chose to stick with the devil they knew
    > because of scarcity, believing it was better to be in a so-so
    > relationship than no relationship at all.

    > at all—these sites offer endless choice, combining to form a vast

in particular "[Possibilities for philanthropy towards achieving more
migration and/or open borders][ma phil]", which lists marriage as a
possible charity intervention to help more people immigrate to the
developed world:

    > Most countries offer essentially unrestricted immigration for the
    > spouses of current citizens, wherever in the world these spouses
    > reside. Encouraging more marriages between Americans (or people in
    > the desired target country of migration) and foreigners might
    > therefore be one method.

    The article mainly talks about how people are very deceptive in how
    they portray themselves in online dating profiles, lying about age,
    weight, income, etc. Not too surprising.
    The article also talks the future of dating. It mentions making
    online dating more "community"-oriented, by bringing friends and
    family into the picture:

    > with them online, all of whom can prowl the profiles, checking

    utilize it.

[^pua]: The emergence of the pickup-artistry (PUA) movement, which tries
