- Current means of finding romantic partners seem astoundingly inefficient.[^pua]
Even online dating sites like OKCupid probably have low-hanging fruit for improvement.

- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a relationship/married.

[^pua]: The emergence of the pickup-artistry (PUA) movement should testify to this to some extent.
