**Romance**, in the context of a cause, refers to the problem of finding
good ways to match people with others who are romantically compatible.
It also refers to the more general problem of helping people enter and
stay in happy romantic relationships.

# What is the problem?

- Current means of finding romantic partners seem astoundingly
  inefficient.[^pua] Even online dating sites like OKCupid probably have
  low-hanging fruit for improvement.

- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a
  relationship/married.  See for instance [rates of divorce in the
  US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_divorce):
  "the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%â€“50%".

Also, OkCupid is officially 18+. While there are def. people below 18 on
it, I don't think there are many under 18 who extensively utilize it.


# Importance

Given how fundamental romance seems to be among humans and how unhappy
people seem to be when their romantic needs go unmet, it seems like
there is a good case to be made for the importance of romance as a
cause.

# Tractability

Given that many people are in happy relationships, the problem is
clearly tractable for some people. It's unclear how tractable this
problem is in full generality. In particular, it seems difficult to
estimate how many more people can be placed in happy relationships given
certain interventions.

# Neglectedness

While there seem to be various books (especially pop science and
self-help books) written on the subject of romance, as well as various
online communities dedicated to helping people meet their romantic needs
(e.g. the pick-up artistry movement), romance doesn't seem to be thought
of as a cause to focus on, in the sense that e.g.  life extension or
existential risk or climate change are thought of as causes.  Approaches
to solving this problem seem rather disparate at the moment, where e.g.
each author of a book advocates their own preferred approach (which may
or may not work for others). In other words, there seems to be a lack of
concerted effort at seriously trying to solve this problem.

More recently, there have been various attempts to solve the matching
problem in romance through online dating sites (e.g. OkCupid) and
various apps (most notorious perhaps is Tinder). However it's unclear
how successful these have been.
