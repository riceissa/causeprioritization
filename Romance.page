**Romance**, in the context of a cause, refers to the problem of
finding good ways to match people with others who are romantically
compatible. It also refers to the more general problem of helping
people enter and stay in happy romantic relationships.

# What is the problem?

- Current means of finding romantic partners seem astoundingly inefficient.[^pua]
Even online dating sites like OKCupid probably have low-hanging fruit for improvement.

- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a relationship/married.
See for instance [rates of divorce in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_divorce): "the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%".

Also, OkCupid is officially 18+. While there are def. people below 18 on it, I don't think there are many under 18 who extensively utilize it.

[^pua]: The emergence of the pickup-artistry (PUA) movement should testify to this to some extent.

# Some places to begin looking

# Importance

Given how fundamental romance seems to be among humans and how unhappy
people seem to be when their romantic needs go unmet, it seems like
there is a good case to be made for the importance of romance as a cause.

# Tractability

FIXME

# Neglectedness

While there seem to be various books (especially pop science and self-help books)
written on the subject of romance, as well as various online communities dedicated
to helping people meet their romantic needs (e.g. the pick-up artistry movement),
romance doesn't seem to be thought of as a cause to focus on, in the sense that e.g.
life extension or existential risk or climate change are thought of as causes.
Approaches to solving this problem seem rather disparate at the moment, where e.g.
each author of a book advocates their own preferred approach (which may or may not
work for others). In other words, there seems to be a lack of concerted effort
at seriously trying to solve this problem.

More recently, there have been various attempts to solve the matching problem in
romance through online dating sites (e.g. OkCupid) and various apps (most notorious
perhaps is Tinder). However it's unclear how successful these have been.
