# What is the problem?

- Current means of finding romantic partners seem astoundingly inefficient.[^pua]
Even online dating sites like OKCupid probably have low-hanging fruit for improvement.

- Many people seem profoundly unhappy even when they are in a relationship/married.
See for instance [rates of divorce in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_United_States#Rates_of_divorce): "the lifelong probability of a marriage ending in divorce is 40%–50%".

[^pua]: The emergence of the pickup-artistry (PUA) movement should testify to this to some extent.
