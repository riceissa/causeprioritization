Consider the possibility that lowering libido might be beneficial to society.

The traditional form of sexual repression (of spreading misinformation and fear, mutilation, etc.) is very unlikely to have been a net benefit.
However, one could still argue that sexual liberation has not been wholly helpful either.

Some general points (with low epistemic confidence):

- For people capable of having sufficient impact in the world, the impact they can make can easily swamp any sexual or romantic pleasures they can derive personally.
Therefore voluntarily suppressing sexual or romantic urges might lead to greater productivity (by having less distractions) and thus greater impact.
Of course there is also the counterpoint that lust can be a useful motivator for work, or that being romantically or sexually fulfilled provides energy to keep working.
But why privilege sexual and romantic desire?
The promise of food, social interaction, video games, learning more math, etc.---essentially anything that one desires---also act as motivators.
And if someone is interested in making the greatest positive impact they can have on the world, they may be interested in curbing these other desires as well.
(Of course, again, sexual and romantic desire could be special.)
- Romantic and sexual urges often are unrequited or unconsummated, which can lead to varying degrees of misery.
If such concerns became a nonproblem, the world might be better off.
- Another way to put it: like everything else pure obsession with sex is unlikely to be optimal (how would anything get done?); if the optimal amount of thinking about sex is lower than how much people currently think about it, then finding ways to lower it seems reasonable.
- Romance and sex (perhaps not the act, but its surrounding actions) often require a lot of time, effort, and money.
As stated in "[Activities Following A Breakup](http://www.breakuprecoveryguide.com/Activities)", "After a breakup, everyone experiences a massive void.
It’s not just an emotional void, a hole in your heart… it’s also literally a hole in your schedule: you have a huge amount of extra free time."
In other words, even if romance can provide a lot of unique benefits, its opportunity cost is high.
