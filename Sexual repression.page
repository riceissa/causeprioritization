Consider the possibility that lowering libido might be beneficial to society.

Some general points (with low epistemic confidence):

- For people capable of having sufficient impact in the world, the impact they can make can easily swamp any sexual or romantic pleasures they can derive personally.
Therefore voluntarily suppressing sexual or romantic urges might lead to greater productivity (by having less distractions) and thus greater impact.
Of course there is also the counterpoint that lust can be a useful motivator for work.
- Romantic and sexual urges often are unrequited or unconsummated, which can lead to varying degrees of misery.
If such concerns became a nonproblem, the world might be better off.

    > that the only cure for the "derangement" would be regular sex

    > As an advocate of sexual abstinence, Kellogg devoted large amounts
    > of his educational and medical work to discouraging sexual
    > activity on the basis of dangers both scientifically understood at
    > the time—as in sexually transmissible diseases—and those taught by
    > the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He set out his views on such
    > matters in one of his larger books, published in various editions
    > around the start of the 20th century under the title Plain Facts
    > about Sexual Life and later Plain Facts for Old and Young. Some of
    > his work on diet was influenced by his belief that a plain and
    > healthy diet, with only two meals a day, among other things, would
    > reduce sexual feelings. Those experiencing temptation were to
    > avoid stimulating food and drinks, and eat very little meat, if
    > any. Kellogg also advocated hydrotherapy and stressed the
    > importance of keeping the colon clean through yogurt enemas.
