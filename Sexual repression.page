Consider the possibility that lowering libido might be beneficial to society.

The traditional form of sexual repression (of spreading misinformation and fear, mutilation, etc.) is very unlikely to have been a net benefit.
However, one could still argue that sexual liberation has not been wholly helpful either.

Some general points (with low epistemic confidence):

- For people capable of having sufficient impact in the world, the impact they can make can easily swamp any sexual or romantic pleasures they can derive personally.
Therefore voluntarily suppressing sexual or romantic urges might lead to greater productivity (by having less distractions) and thus greater impact.
Of course there is also the counterpoint that lust can be a useful motivator for work.
- Romantic and sexual urges often are unrequited or unconsummated, which can lead to varying degrees of misery.
If such concerns became a nonproblem, the world might be better off.
- Another way to put it: like everything else pure obsession with sex is unlikely to be optimal (how would anything get done?); if the optimal amount of thinking about sex is lower than how much people currently think about it, then finding ways to lower it seems reasonable.

    > avoid stimulating food and drinks, and eat very little meat, if
