Consider the possibility that lowering libido might be beneficial to society.

Some general points (with low epistemic confidence):

- For people capable of having sufficient impact in the world, the impact they can make can easily swamp any sexual or romantic pleasures they can derive personally.
Therefore voluntarily suppressing sexual or romantic urges might lead to greater productivity (by having less distractions) and thus greater impact.
Of course there is also the counterpoint that lust can be a useful motivator for work.
- Romantic and sexual urges often are unrequited or unconsummated, which can lead to varying degrees of misery.
If such concerns became a nonproblem, the world might be better off.
