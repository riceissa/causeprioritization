I haven't come across any sort of census or expert opinion compilation regarding population ethics views.

Carl Shulman writes in [this](http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/08/population-ethics-and-inaccessible.html "“Population ethics and inaccessible populations”. Retrieved February 24, 2018.") post: "Aggregative views which embrace Period Independence have a number of theoretical virtues, and may command a plurality in the fractured field of population ethics, but there remains widespread disagreement, on various grounds, and there are reasons to examine the implications of rival views." It's not clear to me how he is coming up with that statement (how much has he read? is the situation difference since 2014? does he have access to some statistics on this? and so on).

It's not even clear to me how many people are currently doing work in population ethics or have done so in the past. (The same names keep coming up so that suggests the field isn't so large.) There are also several people in the rationalist/EA spheres who have written posts/comments on the subject (Carl Shulman, Nick Beckstead, Katja Grace, Ben West, Stuart Armstrong, Toby Ord, and so on).
