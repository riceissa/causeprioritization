# Why do we care?

The [social cost](Social cost of depression) of having many depressed people seems enormous.

It's probably difficult to compare this with other causes (at least directly, using e.g. money), but depression seems similar to other causes like education reform in that it prevents people from becoming more effective. In this sense organizations like CFAR are working on similar problems too.

# Importance

# Tractability

FIXME

Seems more tractable than curing aging, but more or less tractable than curing cancer?

On how well current treatments work:

Not sure if the problem looks something like "productive people are being weighed down by depression, so we just need to remove the depression" or "not very productive, unlucky people get depressed or are more likely to be labeled as depressed, so the problem is making them more effective" (or something completely different). To the extent that the second case is true, then the problem seems to be part of the general problem of "getting people to have more energy / larger drive or be more effective". Then helping depressed people may not be the optimal solution (in terms of getting more productive workers, maybe it would be better purely for alleviating inequality).

# Neglectedness

FIXME

Is the problem that we have treatments but not enough people take them or mostly that our treatments aren't good enough?
