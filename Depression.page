# Why do we care?

The [social cost](Social cost of depression) of having many depressed people seems enormous.

It's probably difficult to compare this with other causes (at least directly, using e.g. money), but depression seems similar to other causes like education reform in that it prevents people from becoming more effective. In this sense organizations like CFAR are working on similar problems too.

# Tractability

FIXME

Seems more tractable than curing aging, but more or less tractable than curing cancer?

# Neglectedness

FIXME

Is the problem that we have treatments but not enough people take them or mostly that our treatments aren't good enough?
