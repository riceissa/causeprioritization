FIXME: write a good intro

It would be a good idea to apply the same sort of idea to other contentious causes.

The concept of a **keyhole solution** is one that is generally useful and seems like it should be more broadly known, but isn't (perhaps because it is often used without being given a name).
A narrower idea is that of **purchasing offsets**, which refers to a particular method of dealing with ....
(mention donating to animal charities while eating meat)

keyhole solutions fit in the more general way of thinking: breaking apart problems (reductionism), examining what is unseen, examining both the costs and benefits, "stifling hyperbole"

[Parable of the broken window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window)

As [the *Open Borders: The Case* page on keyhole solutions](http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions/) explains:

> The term “keyhole solutions” is used for the radical idea of targeting
> specific problems through narrow, targeted solutions rather than
> trying to restrict or control unrelated activity. In the context of
> migration, they involve taxing or restricting specific problematic
> migrant activities rather than a blanket denial of migration.

# Related concepts

In some sense, a keyhole solution gives one an "excuse" to do something that is opposed by taking away at least some of its drawbacks.
From this general framework, one can come up with several other related concepts:

- Coming up with more benefits for something, to promote doing that thing.
- Coming up with more drawbacks for something, to curb that thing.
- Coming up with "excuses" to not do something by achieving its benefits by alternative means

These can be represented in a grid:

| | Pro-action | Anti-action |
|-|:-----------|:------------|
| **Act on benefits** | Finding more benefits | Finding more efficient solutions by asking "Can I get the benefits some other way?"|
| **Act on drawbacks** | Keyhole solutions | Finding more drawbacks |

(actually this table might be incorrect -- e.g. in the case of open borders, one starts with a strong presumption in favor of open borders. So the action would be closing off the borders (akin to an open surgery), and the anti-action would be to stop the borders from closing (akin to a keyhole surgery) by targeting the problems as closely as possible)

If one already wants to do something, it is easy to come up with more and more benefits of that thing.
Similarly if one already does not want to do something, it is easy to come up with excuses to avoid that thing.
However, it is more difficult to focus on the drawbacks of something one wants to do, or the benefits of something one does not want to do.

Also think about how to get what you want in creative ways; in particular, watch out for situations like the following (by Katja Grace, quoted in Yvain's "[Diseased thinking: dissolving questions about disease](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/)"):

    > ...the situation reminds me of a pattern in similar cases I have
    > noticed before. It goes like this. Some people make personal
    > sacrifices, supposedly toward solving problems that don’t threaten
    > them personally. They sort recycling, buy free range eggs, buy
    > fair trade, campaign for wealth redistribution etc. Their actions
    > are seen as virtuous. They see those who don’t join them as
    > uncaring and immoral. A more efficient solution to the problem is
    > suggested. It does not require personal sacrifice. People who have
    > not previously sacrificed support it. Those who have previously
    > sacrificed object on grounds that it is an excuse for people to
    > get out of making the sacrifice. The supposed instrumental action,
    > as the visible sign of caring, has become virtuous in its own
    > right. Solving the problem effectively is an attack on the moral
    > people.

[^offset]: I like this quote from the comment:

    > Cash transfers significantly relieve poverty of humans who are
    > alive today, and are fairly efficient at doing that. They are far
    > less efficient at helping or harming non-human animals or
    > increasing or reducing existential risk. Even if they have some
    > negative effect here or there (more meat-eating, or habitat
    > destruction, or carbon emissions) the cost of producing a
    > comparable benefit to offset it in that dimension will be small
    > compared to the cash transfer. E.g. an allocation of 90%
    > GiveDirectly, and 10% to offset charities (carbon reduction, meat
    > reduction, nuclear arms control, whatever) will wind up positive
    > on multiple metrics.

# Examples of keyhole solutions

## Open borders

- *Open Borders: The Case* has a detailed coverage their [Keyhole solutions](http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions/) page.

## Natalism

From Bryan Caplan's *Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids*:

> If the birth of a human being has a lot of positives and a few
> negatives, the constructive response isn’t to denounce “people.” The
> constructive response is to *selectively target* the negatives. Name
> specific problems, and figure out the cheapest way to handle them.
> 
> Selective targeting requires more imagination than mass sterilization,
> but it’s worth the extra mental effort. If you want to do something
> about man-made global warming, you don’t have to reduce the number of
> human beings on the planet. You just have to get humanity to reduce
> its carbon emissions. A carbon tax is one simple way to get from here
> to there. To discourage emissions, make emissions more expensive, then
> sit back and watch lifestyles and technology adapt. The same principle
> applies to virtually any population problem you can imagine. Don’t
> like congestion at rush hour? An electronically collected toll is a
> straightforward way to get traffic moving again.
> 
> Improving the environment without cutting population is not wishful
> thinking. We’ve been doing it for decades. Resources are more
> abundant. Air and water are cleaner. Problems remain, but the smart
> path to a better world isn’t restraining our numbers. It’s targeting
> specific problems by raising the price of bad behavior. To sterilize
> yourself because your son or daughter will eventually drive a car is
> truly a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

These discuss the idea that betting "stifles hyperbole".
Keyhole solutions also "stifle hyperbole" by forcing one to think of less drastic actions by considering targeting more specific actions.
