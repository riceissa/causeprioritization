title: Flow-through effects
format: markdown
...
Two types of flow-through effects are:

- Indirect: affecting someone other than who you initially targeted
- Long-term: after the present generation is dead

Those are different from:

- Proximate: the immediate effects that occur soon afterward to intended object(s) of an action

Eliezer Yudkowsky argues against using this concept (source: [Post by Eliezer Yudkowsky to the EA Facebook group on flow-through effects](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/900417833347908)<!--archive: [Effective Altruists](https://archive.is/l2LeZ)-->):  

>  Flow-through is not a concept that EA needs. We don't need to agree on utility functions or probability distributions to get together under a tent of 'cause neutrality', 'scope sensitivity', 'thinking on the margins', and 'being willing to quantitatively evaluate impact per dollar and pick the highest-scoring option'. When that leads to different priorities and strategies, we should be able to admit that openly and sort the relevantly concerned people toward their real best options, and not make up stories about flow-through.
