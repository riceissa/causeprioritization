**Cause area classification**

# Possible ways to classify cause areas

|Name|Notes|
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Sub-cause digraph|The idea here is to take inspiration from existing similar taxonomies of e.g. academic fields (examples: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43464/), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_fields), [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_disciplines), [5](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/resdoc/pga_044522)). So similar tree things, but instead of academic fields, you have cause areas in the tree. See [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/riceissa/542f5a9a46e92d7ad2c9aebcce758f32) or [this graph](http://dagitty.net/mKXhKiv) for a prototype.|
|Associated academic fields|For each cause area, use the existing academic outlines to figure out which fields are associated with the cause area, and categorize cause areas by these "associated fields". The hard part is that the fields are already a tree, and you're trying to fit cause areas into this tree, but the cause areas themselves have a graph-like structure.|
|Cause area as academic work|For each cause area, think about which academic field research for that cause would be conducted in, and categorize based on that. Same difficulty as "Associated academic fields" idea.|
|Loop through fields|Reverse the loop of the previous idea and ask for each *field* what cause areas could come out of it. So that could be a way to find new cause areas.|
|Positive vs negative framing|Some cause areas have names like "reducing X" or "anti-X" or "X reform". Is there something "deep" or fundamental about this, or can all causes be framed in positive and negative terms? Like "reducing suffering" might become "increasing lack-of-suffering" and "content creation" might become "lack-of-content reform". If there *is* something fundamental about this positive vs negative framing, then dividing cause areas based on this might be interesting.|
|Values-based classification|Some cause areas seem to be bound to certain terminal values. Like "animal welfare" is tied up with the terminal goal of reducing animal suffering. On the other hand, a cause area like "advancing liberty" might value freedom as a terminal value, but the idea is also that freedom allows you to get to your other terminal values. Something like "content creation" might be a terminal value for someone who values knowledge itself, but for many people it's just an instrumental value.|
|People clusters|The idea is to look at how people tend to cluster into groups in reality, and to use that as a way to group cause areas. So a "descriptive" classification rather than the more "prescriptive" or "ontological" ones mentioned above. This might be hard for really small areas without many people though.|
|Reinvestable causes|In [one of his essays](https://www.facebook.com/groups/674486385982694/permalink/757457624352236/), Eliezer Yudkowsky talks about "reinvestability" and that might be an interesting way to split up causes.|
|Incentive structure|Some sort of classification based on incentives of the people involved in solving problems in each cause area.|
