# Summary

## Places to begin

An expansion of  <http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Social_value_of_basic_science_research> would be nice. Follow-up question: do technological breakthroughs depend more individually on demand for the specific technology, availability of funding, availability of other requisite technologies, and stochastic elements than they do on basic science research? Maybe basic science research is one of the more tractable factors (although funding seems pretty tractable too).

Might be useful to poll physicists and others  who believe they are on the cutting edge of basic science research on what impact they expect to come from such research (maybe specific examples)
