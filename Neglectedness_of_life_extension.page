João Pedro de Magalhães has created the "Who's Who in Gerontology" tool, which lists people and companies working on aging research around the world.
For instance, as of 2014-02-04, the site lists [23 companies](http://whoswho.senescence.info/companies.php) and [284 researchers](http://whoswho.senescence.info/people.php).

Some questions to ask are:

- Are the numbers given above a lot for this type of research?
(How many people are working on other areas of biomedical research?)

- Are the numbers large or small compared to dissimilar fields in academia or other completely unrelated causes?
(This will tell us whether biomedical research in general might be neglected.)

- Even if these numbers are large, it might still be the case that aging research can take on a lot more people.
For instance de Magalhães says how volunteers can help out in labs. (FIXME: find that page)
