I wish there was an interactive tool where you're shown two populations (it could just be those population diagrams where the width of a rectangle is the size and the height is the welfare), and you pick the one you think is better

where the populations can differ by welfare level and size

Some assumptions in population ethics use quantifiers and other stuff that might be tricky to display as a picture. Or how to incorporate [FDT-like trades](Veil_of_ignorance_and_functional_decision_theory).

so then you keep answering a bunch of these questions, and the tool builds a model of your population axiology

and you might run into a case where you accept all the premises that lead up to the repugnant conclusion but you also reject the repugnant conclusion, which creates a contradiction

so then in that case, the tool should detect this and then ask you more questions to try to resolve the contradiction

I think this is basically what philosophers already do ("reflective equilibrium"), except all the scenarios are hidden away in papers

so this is basically like <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook#FaceMash>

except instead of faces you're comparing populations

it's also kind of like <https://beliefs.issarice.com/> (which is itself not very complete at the moment) but for values instead of beliefs

I also want the tool to be able to (directly with a verbal explanation, or indirectly through answering questions) answer questions like "If I assume Totalism/Critical Level view, what bad things (i.e. things I disagree with on reflection) happen?"

There is [this tool](http://www.boxethics.org/editor/) which makes population ethics diagrams, but doesn't have any other logic as far as I can tell.
