I wish there was an interactive tool where you're shown two populations, and you pick the one you think is better

where the populations can differ by welfare level and size

so then you keep answering a bunch of these questions, and the tool builds a model of your population axiology

and you might run into a case where you accept all the premises that lead up to the repugnant conclusion but you also reject the repugnant conclusion, which creates a contradiction

so then in that case, the tool should detect this and then ask you more questions to try to resolve the contradiction

I think this is basically what philosophers already do ("reflective equilibrium"), except all the scenarios are hidden away in papers

so this is basically like <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook#FaceMash>

except instead of faces you're comparing populations

it's also kind of like <https://beliefs.issarice.com/> (which is itself not very complete at the moment) but for values instead of beliefs
