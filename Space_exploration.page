# Problem

## Causal logic

Earth has limited space and resources. Colonization of other worlds could substantially increase the size and average wealth of humanity. Additionally, Earth faces various global catastrophic risks; expansion to other areas would allow the human race to continue in the event of extinction on Earth.

## Evidence

There is good evidence for fundamental limits in the capacity of Earth to support humans. There is some evidence for global catastrophes that might destroy Earth while leaving extraterrestrial colonies alive.

## Scope

Realistic plans for extraterrestrial colonies would have far lower populations than the Earth. Therefore, escaping an Earthly extinction event with a colony would have a much smaller payoff than preventing the event in the first place.

Interstellar colonization could potentially increase the reach of humanity by many orders of magnitude. 

# Solutions

## Solar system terraforming

## Interstellar travel
