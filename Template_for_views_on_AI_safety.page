# Paths to AGI

|Path|Timeline for when we reach AGI|Probability that we first reach AGI using this path|Safety rating|Implications (e.g. emergence of singleton, takeoff shape, self-modification)|
|----|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
|De novo|||||
|Neuromorphic|||||
|Whole brain emulation|||||
|Intelligence enhancement|||||

# Approaches to alignment

|Approach|Time/resource cost to achieve alignment|Probability of this approach working in principle (i.e. ignoring AI timelines)|How competitive this approach would be with unaligned AGI|Number of serial discoveries needed/how parallelizable the approach is|
|--------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Highly reliable agent design|
|Task-directed AGI|
|Paul Christiano's approach (are there multiple?)|
|Inverse reinforcement learning|
|Learning from human preferences|
|Adversarial examples|
|Working on philosophical questions|
|Indirect normativity|
|Coherent extrapolated volition|

<https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2017/08/16/portfolio-approach-to-ai-safety-research/> also suggests various "properties" to group the different alignment approaches.

# The role of philosophy

Eliezer has said something to the effect that "copy-pasting a strawberry hits
95% of the interesting alignment problems", but he has also said we can't do
with anything less than full human morality, or something similar. Wei Dai
[pointed this out](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154690145854228?comment_id=10154691157704228&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D)
in a Facebook thread. I think this is related to the "how much
philosophy do we need to understand?" question but probably distinct.

Implicit in the philosophical pessimism that Wei Dai has seems to be the
idea that if we don't do philosophy right, the expected value of the far
future will be catastrophically bad or small or whatever, rather than
merely "okay" or "pretty good" or "very good, but still far from optimal".

|Topic|

|Role of philosophy in alignment|
|How much philosophy do we need to understand? Do we need to specify "all of human morality"?|
|How benign does the environment need to be to get philosophy right?|
|Weird failure modes (e.g. siren/marketing worlds, malign prior)|

# Miscellaneous questions

|Topic|
|-----------------------|
|Hardware overhang|
|Openness vs secrecy|
|Race dynamics|
|Differential development/stuff about desirability of slow technological development|
|Ability reduce problems to learning problems; see [here](https://arbital.com/p/taskagi_open_problems/)|
|Amount of hardware required for first AGI|
|State involvement|
|Ceiling for artificial intelligence (e.g. some people think AGI isn't even possible in principle, and even those who believe AGI is possible have different views on how much smarter than a human a AGI could be)|
|Singleton/multipolar scenarios|
|Best-case scenario/mainline success scenario|
