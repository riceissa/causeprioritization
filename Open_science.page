Indie science could be a way beyond that. Right now, most scientists need to publish in top journals to even have a shot at a scientific career. If funding can be decoupled from publications (through mechanisms such as crowdfunding or [basic income]()), then it may be possible for people to focus completely on science without wasting hours of time writing grants or teaching. Also, they could publish online through living documents (and since their career isn't at stake from being open, they can afford to be as open as possible).

Open science means less "reinventing the wheel".
