Indie science could be a way beyond that. Right now, most scientists need to publish in top journals to even have a shot at a scientific career. If funding can be decoupled from publications (through mechanisms such as crowdfunding or [basic income]()), then it may be possible for people to focus completely on science without wasting hours of time writing grants or teaching. Also, they could publish online through living documents (and since their career isn't at stake from being open, they can afford to be as open as possible).

Open science means less "reinventing the wheel".

Open science can include promoting new ways of producing, sharing, reviewing, and evaluating scientific research.

> Some for-profit organizations have gotten significant funding; on the nonprofit side, there are several foundations working on various aspects of the problem, though most are relatively new to the space. We have the sense that there is currently little funding available for groups focused on changing incentives and doing advocacy (as opposed to building tools and platforms), though we don’t have high confidence in this view.

> We see less “room for more philanthropy” in the space of supporting tools and platforms than we expected, partly because of the presence of for-profit organizations, some of which have substantial funding.

> We see more such room in the space of “advocacy and incentives” than we expected, as most of the organizations in that category seem to have relatively little in terms of funding.

**Research Integrity**  
Funder: Laura and John Arnold Foundation  
Description: "The Research Integrity initiative is aimed at improving the reliability and validity of scientific evidence across fields that inform governmental policy, philanthropic endeavors and individual decision-making.  As a society, we often rely on published scientific research to guide our policy, health and lifestyle choices.  In some fields, the research is rigorous and thorough. In other areas, it is weak, spurious and unreliable."  
Organizations currently funding: Center for Open Science ($5M grant)  

**Scholarly Communications and Information Technology**

Organizations currently funding: Hypothes.is, Scalar, many others  

**Life Science Entrepreneurship**  
Funder: Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation  
Description: "Much of the progress in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease can be attributed to medical research in university labs. The Kauffman Foundation is identifying barriers that slow or deter life science innovators—the scientists in those labs—from getting their discoveries to the health care market. The Foundation’s Life Science Entrepreneurship program includes a host of initiatives designed to help life science entrepreneurs commercialize their research to benefit patients."  

**Research Tools and Science Metrics divisions**  
Funder: Digital Science  
Description: Part of Macmillan Publishers, owner of Nature, incubator and funder for new tools  
Organizations currently funding: Figshare, Altmetric.com, Projects
