Indie science could be a way beyond that. Right now, most scientists need to publish in top journals to even have a shot at a scientific career. If funding can be decoupled from publications (through mechanisms such as crowdfunding or [basic income]()), then it may be possible for people to focus completely on science without wasting hours of time writing grants or teaching. Also, they could publish online through living documents (and since their career isn't at stake from being open, they can afford to be as open as possible).

Open science means less "reinventing the wheel".

Open science can include promoting new ways of producing, sharing, reviewing, and evaluating scientific research.

> Academics seek to publish in prestigious journals; academics largely assess each other (for purposes of awarding tenure among other things) by their records of publishing in prestigious journals. Yet the traditional system is problematic in many ways:  

> - Journals usually charge fees for access to publications; an alternative publication system could include universal open access to academic research.  
> - Journals use a time-consuming peer-review process that doesn’t necessarily ensure that a paper is reliable or error-free.  
> - Journals often fail to encourage or facilitate optimal sharing of data and code (as well as preregistration), and the journal system gives authors little reason to go out of their way to share.  
> - Journals often have conventions that run counter to the goal of producing as much social value as possible. They may favor “newsworthy” results, leading to publication bias; they may favor publishing novel analysis over replications, reanalyses and debates; they may have arbitrary length requirements that limit the amount of detail that can be included; they may have other informal preferences that discourage certain forms of investigation, even when those investigations would be highly valuable. This is particularly problematic because considerations about “what a top journal might publish” appears to drive much of the incentive structure for researchers.  


# Neglectedness

In 2016, GiveWell wrote that:^[[Our landscape of the open science community](https://blog.givewell.org/2013/07/11/our-landscape-of-the-open-science-community/)]

> Some for-profit organizations have gotten significant funding; on the nonprofit side, there are several foundations working on various aspects of the problem, though most are relatively new to the space. We have the sense that there is currently little funding available for groups focused on changing incentives and doing advocacy (as opposed to building tools and platforms), though we don’t have high confidence in this view.

> We see less “room for more philanthropy” in the space of supporting tools and platforms than we expected, partly because of the presence of for-profit organizations, some of which have substantial funding.

> We see more such room in the space of “advocacy and incentives” than we expected, as most of the organizations in that category seem to have relatively little in terms of funding.

# Interventions
In 2016, GiveWell wrote about possible interventions.^[[Our landscape of the open science community](https://blog.givewell.org/2013/07/11/our-landscape-of-the-open-science-community/)]  

**Altmetrics**  

> Metrics for evaluating the use/influence/importance of research that go beyond the traditional measures of “where a paper is published and how many citations it has.

**Open access publishing**  

> Innovative open access publishing, including preprints – Models that facilitate sharing research publicly rather than simply publishing it in closed journals, sometimes prior to any peer review occurring.  

**Sharing data and code**  

> Projects that encourage researchers to share more information about their research, by providing tools to make sharing easier or by creating incentives to share.  

**Reproducibility**  

> Projects that focus on assessing and improving the reproducibility of research, something that the traditional journal system has only very limited mechanisms to address.  

**Attribution**  

> Tools allowing researchers to cite each others’ work in nontraditional ways, thus encouraging nontraditional practices (such as data-sharing).  

**Alternative publication and peer review models**  

> Providing novel ways for researchers to disseminate their research processes and findings and have them reviewed (pre-publication).  

**Social networks**  

> Platforms encouraging researchers to connect with each other, and in the process to share their research in nontraditional forums.
