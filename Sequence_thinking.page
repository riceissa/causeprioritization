**Sequence thinking** is a type of thinking where one comes to a conclusion through a chain of "best guesses".
It contrasts with [cluster thinking]().
It was first explicitly defined by Holden Karnofsky in "[Sequence Thinking vs. Cluster Thinking](http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/)".
