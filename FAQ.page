# Why did you go with this platform (instead of the one you used for the Timelines Wiki)?

# (how) should I sign my name if I edit the Discuss page (ex.: I want to comment on "merge cryonics page with life extension/aging stuff?" here: https://causeprioritization.org/@Main_Page)

# (how) can I tag a user on the Discuss page?

# What nomenclature / classification should we use to classify causes? Ex.: Is "Existential Risks" a category, "AI Safety" a cause area within that category, and "decision theory research" an intervention within that cause area? If so, then should we group the cause areas on the main page by categories?

# Who are current editors of the wiki?
