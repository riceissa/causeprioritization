...

> As to the consequences of not doing what you think you "must," ask
> yourself: Why must you finish college? Will you be unable to make a
> living if you don't? Will people you like refuse your company if you
> don't? Will you be a bad person if you don't? Or do you think you must
> finish college because a relative once told you that you "must," when
> you were a child?
> 
> You may experience an extraordinary sense of relief when you suddenly
> conclude that you don't have to do something or be something you
> believed that you "must." You can feel free as a bird and light as a
> feather after feeling weighted down and overloaded by the unwelcome
> burden. Try for yourself! Ask yourself honestly: Why must I do ---- ?
> And what will happen if I don't?
