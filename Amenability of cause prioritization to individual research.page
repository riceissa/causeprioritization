A valuable question to ask is whether cause prioritization can be advanced by individuals or small groups.
In other words, can lowly individuals with (possibly) little experience accomplish anything in this domain?
Even if individual research is not the most effective, one could for instance make the argument that existing research is too closed, too risk-averse, and so on.

For instance Katja Grace [says](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzpq81arki89gd9/Cause%20Prioritization%20Shallow%20Overview.docx) ([archive](http://exp.riceissa.com/pdf/Cause%20Prioritization%20Shallow%20Overview.pdf)) (pg 8, 11):

> Prioritization research seems relatively amenable to modular independent contributions, and relevant research inputs seem even more so

and suggests to

>Coordinate interested amateurs to do in-depth work together, or try out this kind of work on a small scale. e.g. choose a larger project together, such as evaluating education improvement in the developing world, and break it up into parts, so that for instance one person investigates the effect of education on fertility, and another the effect on income, etc.

Paul Christiano [says](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PWLgBDlk2MxEuJvY5OeG4UpFgso0yvJVf9xrTJkHSQ/edit#heading=h.26in1rg) ([archive](http://exp.riceissa.com/pdf/DraftTheCaseforCausePrioritization.pdf)):

> it appears that to date there are no intellectually substantial, transparent, relatively widely known efforts to identify and prioritize high-impact causes. Thus even a failed project could have a large positive impact if it managed to hold itself to high intellectual standards, achieved a modest profile, and was transparent about its reasoning. Such a project would allow successors to understand the difficulties of cause prioritization more clearly, which would facilitate future efforts or provide adequate justification to abandon a failed approach.

> Merely experimenting with different approaches seems likely to yield useful information if done publicly and openly, in light of the small amount of work that has been done to date.
