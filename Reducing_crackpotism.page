> Perhaps the biggest neglected problem is that of cranks and crackpots. Consider the percentage of the U.S. population that believes one or more of the following:
>
> Obama wasn't born in the U.S. 
>
> Vaccines cause autism
>
> 9/11 was an inside job
>
> Global warming is a myth
>
> The world is about 6000 years old
>
> HIV was created as a bioweapon
>
> American Indians are descended from ancient Jews
>
> Crackpotism seems like a minor problem, but it wasn't that long ago that a crackpot conspiracy theorist took control of a major world power and the result was World War II and the Holocaust.
