This is pretty self-evident. People waste a huge amount of time on "non-productive things" (TV, lectures, comparison shopping, certain video games, "short content" on social media, etc). 

There's the phrase "time you enjoy is not time wasted", but even if we accounted for that, there are many areas for improvement.
