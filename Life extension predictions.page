A conference report published in 1976[^neugarten] states:

[^neugarten]:
Bernice L. Neugarten and Robert J. Havighurst.
*Social Policy, Social Ethics, and the Aging Society*.
1976.
A report prepared for the National Science Foundation.

> There is also the possibility (in the minds of some gerontologists, the probability) that the human life span will be extended another 5 years by the year 2000.

Question: did this happen? i.e. did the human life span increase by 5 years from 1976 to 2000?
(also do they mean average life span or in absolute terms?)
