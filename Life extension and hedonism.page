This is the argument that, roughly, old people will just live and do pleasurable things without working, thus consuming resources that might have been better-spent.

> Why should the young respect, much less help and support, old people who mean to live for their own pleasure?
And since the young can understand the delights of pleasure also, why should they not---well tutored by their elders---adopt a similar value?
Would that not carry with it an untoward implication, however: that the old and their claims on pleasure and the resources necessary for its full pursuit could interfere with the young's pursuit of *their* pleasure?
Might not the young then conclude that they should take priority?
