# Problem

## Causal logic

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by human industrial activity will increase the Earth's surface temperature. This will worsen the productivity of ecosystems, reduce agriculture and fishing output, exacerbate water shortages, exacerbate weather-related risks, worsen human health, and displace people.^[[(IPCC AR5 SPM)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf)] These factors could also contribute to conflict in troubled regions.

## Evidence

The evidence base for anthropogenic climate change is robust. Warming of 2°C or more is commonly expected. 

There are small chances of warming to 4°C or greater. Assuming the most pessimistic out of four climate scenarios (RCP8.5), it is 'likely' (66-100% chance) that climate change will be between 2.6 and 4.8°C by 2100,^[[(IPCC AR5)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)] which would imply a small but notable chance of warming exceeding 4.8°C ("perhaps around 10%"^[[80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/)]). Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather claims that we seem closest to RCP8.5 but it's too hard to really tell.^[[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hausfath/status/1070786043597643776)] Of course it's plausible that things will be worse than RCP8.5.

Varying amounts of evidence substantiate specific consequences expected of climate change. The strength of the link between climate change and severe weather is disputed. The strength of the link between climate change and conflict is disputed.^[[(The Atlantic)](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/does-climate-change-cause-more-war/553040/)]

## Scope

Giving What We Can investigated the short run direct human impacts of climate change and estimated that it takes 258,200 tonnes of emissions to cause one death by 2054.^[[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/report/modelling-climate-change-cost-effectiveness/)]

There have been numerous efforts to quantify the long run economic costs of climate change, generally looking at 2100 as the benchmark year. A 2017 metanalysis estimated a 9-10% loss to global GDP from 3°C of warming.^[[Howard and Sterner (2017)](https://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/HowardSternerMetaanalysis.pdf)] Another 2017 metanalysis estimated a 1.8% loss from 3°C of warming.^[[Nordhaus and Moffat (2017)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23646.pdf)] A 2018 statistical test of climate models found that the best performing models estimate a 1-2% loss,^[[Newell et al (2018)](https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/the-gdp-temperature-relationship-implications-for-climate-change-damages/)] though model uncertainty would imply a higher number because damage estimates are right-skewed.

A disproportionate amount of the damage from climate change is expected to fall upon poorer, developing nations. Therefore the human welfare costs will be greater than those suggested by the global GDP estimates. 

GiveWell argued that the risk of extreme climate change adds substantially to the expected cost.^[[GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks)] Note however that they based their assessment on the most pessimistic out of six older emissions scenarios, which held that 2.4°C - 6.4°C of warming is likely.

Climate change will disrupt the environment, but it's not clear whether this would increase or decrease wildlife suffering.^[[(Tomasik 2018)](https://reducing-suffering.org/climate-change-and-wild-animals/)]

John Halstead found that there is no support for the claim that climate change is a direct existential risk.^[[Halstead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmHh-cshTCMT8LX0Y5wSQm8FMBhaxhQ8OlOeRLkXIF0/edit)] Climate change may still indirectly contribute to existential risks by worsening and disrupting civilization, although a similar thing may be said for many other problems such as disease and governance.

# Solutions

## Clean energy

Research and lobbying can accelerate the adoption of clean energy. 

In 2019, Let's Fund found that public spending on clean energy R&D is the most effective climate intervention. They recommend donations to the [Information Technology and Innovation Foundation](https://www.itif.org/).^[[Let's Fund](https://lets-fund.org/clean-energy/)] 

In 2018, Founders Pledge estimated that carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and low carbon innovation are the highest priority sectors to work on, whereas solar power, wind power and energy efficiency are lower priorities. Founders Pledge prioritized work in India over work in the US and China, while still prioritizing work in the US and China over work in the EU. They estimated that [Clean Air Task Force](https://www.catf.us/) is one of the two most efficient climate change charities, averting CO2e at a rate of approximately $0.10-1/tonne.^[[Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change)]

### Other impacts

Clean energy has other benefits for public health. It reduces US reliance on foreign energy. It preserves the store of fossil fuels in case they are needed for crises in the future.

## Forest protection

Preventing deforestation preserves vegetation that filters CO2 out of the atmosphere. In 2018, Founders Pledge estimated that forestry and land use is a high priority sector to work on climate change.^[[Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change)] They also estimate that [Coalition for Rainforest Nations](https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/) is one of the two most efficient climate change charities, by averting CO2e at a rate of approximately $0.12/tonne. 

In 2013, Giving What We Can estimated that [Cool Earth](http://www.coolearth.org/) is the most efficient climate change charity out of those considered, reducing CO2e at approximately $0.81/tonne.^[[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/climate-change)] However, a more recent report explains that the initial report was overly optimistic.^[[Sanjay](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth)]

### Other impacts

Forest protection has some other benefits for sustainability and public health.

Forest protection also increases the wildlife population, which may be good or bad depending on the quality of wild animal experiences. There is disagreement on whether there is more suffering than happiness among wildlife.^[[Plant 2016](http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/the-unproven-and-unprovable-case-for-wild-animal-suffering/)] ^[[Tomasik 2016](https://reducing-suffering.org/net-suffering-nature-reply-michael-plant/)]

## Carbon pricing

Economists mostly agree that the government should implement market solutions (a carbon tax or cap-and-trade) rather than regulations.^[[Howard and Sylvan 2015](https://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf)] ^[[IGM Survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-tax)] Carbon taxes are in turn better than cap-and-trade.^[[IGM survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/climate-change-policies)] They are a better way of raising government revenue than broad hikes to income taxes.^[[IGM Survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-taxes-ii)]

However, Let's Fund argues that carbon pricing can still lead to under-investment in clean energy R&D, because it can let companies rely on technologies that will not be as useful for curbing future emissions in the developing world. In addition, carbon pricing is a less neglected and tractable policy goal. Therefore carbon price lobbying is a lower philanthropic priority than clean energy R&D.^[[Let's Fund](https://lets-fund.org/clean-energy/)]

Eliminating fossil fuel subsidies follows the same path as establishing carbon pricing. However, Let's Fund finds that it's too minor and intractable to be a high priority.^[[Let's Fund](https://lets-fund.org/clean-energy/)]

### Other impacts

Carbon pricing will have other benefits to public health. It will reduce US reliance on foreign energy. It will increase the store of fossil fuels in case they are needed in the future.

## Geoengineering

Geoengineering could shape the Earth's climate and counteract the greenhouse effect. Halstead argues that solar geoengineering research should not be pursued right now.^[[Halstead](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bKHjJBkfdHhA3SFJh/the-case-for-delaying-solar-geoengineering-research)]

## Vegetarianism

Promoting vegetarian/vegan diets would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, even assuming a very low figure ($11) for the average cost to convert someone to vegetarian, it costs approximately $7/tonne of CO2e avoided, making it a poor choice for fighting climate change.^[[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2013/11/less-burn-for-your-buck-part-ii/)]

Personally switching from an average diet to a vegan diet only saves 1 tonne of CO2e per year.^[[Shrink That Footprint](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet)]

### Other impacts

Vegetarian and vegan diets reduce farm animal suffering.

## Adaptation

Localities can adapt to climate change by building better infrastructure or making other changes. If adaptation is considered as an intervention, then adaptation in the developing world would presumably be most effective.

But unlike actions to prevent climate change, adaptation is not a global coordination problem, so we might expect localities to adapt fairly well on their own.

80,000 Hours regards extreme risks from climate change as "sometimes recommended", appropriate for some people though not their highest rating.^[[80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/)]

The 2017 EA survey did not ask directly about climate change, but it did ask about environmentalism as a cause area. Environmentalism had the fourth highest number of people calling it the top priority, out of nine cause areas in the survey. It also had the fourth highest number of people saying that no EA resources should go towards it.^[[2017 EA Survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xeduPnHfCQ9m9f3go/ea-survey-2017-series-cause-area-preferences)]
