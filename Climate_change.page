# Problem

## Causal logic

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by human industrial activity will increase the Earth's surface temperature. This will worsen the productivity of ecosystems, reduce agriculture and fishing output, exacerbate water shortages, exacerbate weather-related risks, worsen human health, and displace people [(IPCC AR5 SPM)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf).

## Evidence

The evidence base for anthropogenic climate change is robust. Warming of 2°C or more is commonly expected. 

There are small chances of warming to 4°C or greater. Assuming the most pessimistic out of four climate scenarios (RCP8.5), it is 'likely' (66-100% chance) that climate change will be between 2.6 and 4.8°C by 2100 [(IPCC AR5)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf), which would imply a small but notable chance of warming exceeding 4.8°C. Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather [claims](https://twitter.com/hausfath/status/1070786043597643776) that we seem closest to RCP8.5 but it's too hard to really tell. Of course this makes it plausible that things will be worse than RCP8.5.

Varying amounts of evidence substantiate specific consequences expected of climate change. The link between climate change and severe weather is disputed.

## Scope

Numerous metanalyses attempt to quantify the economic costs of climate change. [Howard and Sterner (2017)](https://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/HowardSternerMetaanalysis.pdf) estimate a 9-10% loss to global GDP from 3°C of warming. [Nordhaus and Moffat (2017)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23646.pdf) estimate a 1.8% loss from 3°C of warming. [Newell et al (2018)](https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/the-gdp-temperature-relationship-implications-for-climate-change-damages/) say that the best performing models estimate a 1-2% cost, though model uncertainty could imply a higher number because damage estimates are right-skewed.

A disproportionate amount of the damage from climate change is expected to fall upon poorer, developing nations. Therefore the human welfare costs will be greater than those suggested by the global GDP estimates. 

[Givewell argued](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks) that the risk of extreme climate change adds substantially to the expected cost. Note however that they based their assessment on an older emissions model and estimated a 10% chance of at least 6.4°C of warming.

Climate change will disrupt the environment, but it's not clear whether this would increase or decrease wildlife suffering [(Tomasik 2018)](https://reducing-suffering.org/climate-change-and-wild-animals/).

[John Halstead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmHh-cshTCMT8LX0Y5wSQm8FMBhaxhQ8OlOeRLkXIF0/edit) found an absence of evidence that climate change is a direct existential risk. [Ozymandias argues](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eJPjSZKyT4tcSGfFk/climate-change-is-in-general-not-an-existential-risk) that climate change is generally not an existential risk. Climate change may still indirectly contribute to existential risks by worsening and disrupting civilization, although a similar thing may be said for many other problems such as disease and governance.

# Solutions

## Forest protection

Stopping deforestation preserves vegetation that filters CO2 out of the atmosphere. In 2018, [Founders Pledge estimated](https://founderspledge.com/research/Cause%20Report%20-%20Climate%20Change.pdf) that forestry and land use is a high priority sector to work on climate change.

They also estimate that Coalition for Rainforest Nations is one of the two most efficient climate change charities, by averting CO2e at a rate of approximately $0.12/tonne. 

In 2013, [Giving What We Can estimated](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/climate-change) that [Cool Earth](http://www.coolearth.org/) is the most efficient climate change charity out of those considered, reducing CO2e at approximately $0.81/tonne. However, [a more recent report by Sanjay](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RnmZ62kuuC8XzeTBq/why-we-have-over-rated-cool-earth) explains that the initial report was overly optimistic.

## Pollution control

Political lobbying can spur regulations and reforms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, [Founders Pledge estimated](https://founderspledge.com/research/Cause%20Report%20-%20Climate%20Change.pdf) that carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and low carbon innovation are the highest priority sectors to work on. Solar and wind power and energy efficiency are lower priorities. They also prioritize work in India over work in the US and China, while still prioritizing work in the US and China over work in the EU.

They also estimated that Clean Air Task Force is one of the two most efficient climate change charities, averting CO2e at a rate of approximately $1/tonne.

## Geoengineering

Geoengineering could shape the Earth's climate and counteract the greenhouse effect. [Halstead argues](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bKHjJBkfdHhA3SFJh/the-case-for-delaying-solar-geoengineering-research) that solar geoengineering research should not be pursued right now.
