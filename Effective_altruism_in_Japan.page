# Upshot

Japan, despite being quite populous, has *absolutely no community around effective altruism*.
Peter Singer's book/TED talk seem to have been translated into the language, but that is the extent to which EA is known.
Taking into account Japan's relative prosperity, it may be useful to build a community around EA in Japan.

A partial (and very rough) translation of the EA Wikipedia article is [available here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9).

There is also a possibly nascent [Tokyo Less Wrong meetup group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LessWrongTokyo).

Nick Bostrom's book _Superintelligence_ was [translated](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9-%E8%B6%85%E7%B5%B6AI%E3%81%A8%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E3%81%AE%E5%91%BD%E9%81%8B-%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9C%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD%E3%83%A0/dp/4532357071/) into Japanese and published in November 2017.
