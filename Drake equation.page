The **Drake equation** was first [used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation).
The idea is to calculate the number of possible planets (which is itself calculated) and to keep taking fractions of that number according to various parameters.

The general "cause prioritization Drake equation" would be to estimate the gains from a cause (roughly the "importance") and to keep taking fractions of those gains according to uncertainties.
