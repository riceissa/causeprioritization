If we could encourage more people to have an abundance mentality (rather than a scarcity mentality - much of it coming from zero-sum thinking), I feel that much more can be done.

It would be great if there was more evidence than what can be found in uncited self-help books.

Basic questions:

- Is getting more people to have an abundance mentality *in general* a good idea?
If it isn't, then is it still a good idea in specific contexts (e.g. at the workplace, in school, in dating, when dealing with friends and family)?
- What sorts of interventions are possible, and how tractable are they?
This cause fits under a general "getting society to be nicer/more moral" framework, so relevant results could be transferred here.
- See also [General questions for causes]().

# Importance

Various people have written about the importance of adopting an "abundance mindset" instead of a "scarcity mindset" (which encourages competition).
However, it isn't clear to what extent these claims are true or whether they apply generally or to just some specific cases.
Discussion of "abundance mindset" versus "scarcity mindset" mostly takes place by presenting generalizations from anecdotes and remain unconvincing.

Some quotes from *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People#Abundance_mentality)*:

> Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality.
> They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one
> pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it
> would mean less for everybody else. The Scarcity Mentality is the
> zero-sum paradigm of life.
> 
> People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very difficult time sharing
> recognition and credit, power or profit—even with those who help in
> the production. They also have a very hard time being genuinely happy
> for the successes of other people—even, and sometimes especially,
> members of their own family or close friends and associates. It’s
> almost as if something is being taken from them when someone else
> receives special recognition or windfall gain or has remarkable
> success or achievement.
> 
> Although they might verbally express happiness for others’ success,
> inwardly they are eating their hearts out. Their sense of worth comes
> from being compared, and someone else’s success, to some degree, means
> their failure. Only so many people can be “A” students; only one
> person can be “number one.” To “win” simply means to “beat.”

> One thing I have found particularly helpful to Win/Lose people in

> experience the Win/Win philosophy in action.



It seems to IK that most people have an artificial scarcity mindset (much of it coming from the socialization effects of K-12 education itself).

The Internet makes it easier for people with abundance mindsets to share than ever before.

Also it would be interesting to explore abundance mindsets in dating and relationships (e.g. [compersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory#Compersion)).
