GiveWell has a page on [Anthropogenic climate change](http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/climate-change).

Giving What We Can has conducted a [brief search](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/climate-change) for relatively effective means of reducing greenhouse emissions, focusing largely on charities. [Cool Earth](http://www.coolearth.org/) was evaluated as most effective among the options considered. Cool earth is estimated to reduce emissions by one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent for $0.81.
