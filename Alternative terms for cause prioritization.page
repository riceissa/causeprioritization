Cause prioritization as an effort associated with the effective altruism movement is a fairly recent development. However, other efforts to prioritize between different causes and interventions have existed before this. What are these efforts, and what names did they go by?

- In global health, **priority setting** seems to be in use.
- Some people use **cause selection** instead of cause prioritization.
