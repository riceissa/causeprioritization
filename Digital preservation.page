**Digital preservation** refers to the task of ensuring that "digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable"^[[Digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation).].
In particular, a lot of the information on the internet depends on other online resources through referencing and hyperlinking.

# Importance

    Here is an interesting point, although I think this would be an argument *against* digital preservation (i.e. that since information is so abundant it is replaceable by similar information, so archiving isn't as important):

    > The recommendations to raise awareness and push out training are

    > and to resonate with their needs. We are so drawn in by effective

    > consumption is now very highly selective and the digital
    > preservation community needs to act on this reality.

- From [Why I Prefer Public Conversations](http://reducing-suffering.org/why-i-prefer-public-conversations/):

    Similarly, content needs to be continually backed up if it is to be accessible by a future AGI.

# Tractability

There are several levels of tractability with regard to digital preservation:

- The tractability of the ultimate goal of archiving all of the web. This is impossible to do fully, but at least a large amount of the web can be (and has been) archived. Some things to consider there are:
    - How difficult is it to enumerate all sites that need to be archived?
- The tractability of archiving individual sites. Static pages that just have HTML/CSS are the easiest, but those that have more complicated media (e.g. Flash, videos) are more difficult to archive, as are sites that use AJAX/Javascript to dynamically load content (e.g. sites that employ infinite scrolling). In addition, some sites use IP blocking to prevent people from archiving the site.
    - Figuring out the scope of websites seems tractable. Even for sites like [the Internet Archive](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK), there seem to be concrete figures on what it would take to fully backup the site.
- In general, unlike causes that involve technological progress (e.g. artificial intelligence) or policy changes (e.g. open borders), digital preservation produces definite results given increased effort or resources.

# Neglectedness

- [Digital Preservation Policies Study](https://web.archive.org/web/20110413152311/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/preservation/jiscpolicy_p1finalreport.pdf) (pg 6), which is for institutions, which is a bit different:

    > Across many sectors the development of institutional preservation
    > policies is currently sporadic and digital preservation issues are
    > rarely considered in key strategic plans. The lack of preservation
    > policies and as a result the lack of consideration of digital
    > preservation issues in other institutional strategies is seen as a
    > major stumbling block and has prompted the commissioning of this
    > study.

# Differential intellectual progress

Looking at digital preservation from the viewpoint of [Differential intellectual progress](), it is important to note that since archiving old content does not directly produce technological or intellectual advances there are no direct increases in the relevant risks (e.g. the risk of producing harmful nanotechnology).
However it must be noted that there still indirect risks involved; for instance, preserving content regarding certain technologies or promoting blind technological advancement will increase the visibility of such content, which may in turn increase risks.
