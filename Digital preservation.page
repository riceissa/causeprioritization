**Digital preservation** refers to the task of ensuring that "digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable"^[[Digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation).].
In particular, a lot of the information on the internet depends on other online resources through referencing and hyperlinking.

# Tractability

There are several levels of tractability with regard to digital preservation:

- The tractability of the ultimate goal of archiving all of the web. This impossible to do fully, but at least a large amount of the web can be (and has been) archived. Some things to consider there are:
    - How difficult is it to enumerate all sites that need to be archived?
- The tractability of archiving individual sites. Static pages that just have HTML/CSS are the easiest, but those that have more complicated media (e.g. Flash, videos) are more difficult to archive, as are sites that use AJAX/Javascript to dynamically load content (e.g. sites that employ infinite scrolling). In addition, some sites use IP blocking to prevent people from archiving the site.
    - Figuring out the scope of websites seems tractable. Even for sites like [the Internet Archive](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK), there seems to be concrete figures on what it would take to fully backup the site.
