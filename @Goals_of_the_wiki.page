# Wikipedia and the Cause Prioritization wiki
Should we state explicitly that this wiki is not meant to duplicate efforts to improve Wikipedia articles, but rather be complementary by adding information that couldn't be added on Wikipedia, either because it's not notable enough, doesn't have enough reliable sources, or uses different formatting (for example)? And maybe also sometimes a place where we can work on articles before transferring the content on Wikipedia. Gwern wrote more on this in [Wikipedia and Other Wikis](https://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia-and-Other-Wikis).

And should we recommend to link to the related Wikipedia article for every article on the CP wiki? At the top? Or maybe in the external links section?
