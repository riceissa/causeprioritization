# Wikipedia and the Cause Prioritization wiki
Should we state explicitly that this wiki is not meant to duplicate efforts to improve Wikipedia articles, but rather be complementary by adding information that couldn't be added on Wikipedia, either because it's not notable enough, doesn't have enough reliable sources, or uses different formatting (for example)? And maybe also sometimes a place where we can work on articles before transferring the content on Wikipedia. Gwern wrote more on this in [Wikipedia and Other Wikis](https://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia-and-Other-Wikis).

And should we recommend to link to the related Wikipedia article for every article on the CP wiki? At the top? Or maybe in the external links section?

I see CPW as doing a pretty different thing (doing research to compare cause areas) from what Wikipedia is doing (making a generic encyclopedia). There might be some overlap in coverage (e.g. both can cover the same organization or the same cause area), but I would expect the structure of pages, the intended audience, the specific content covered, etc., to be quite different between the two wikis. I'm not sure what concrete examples you have in mind where there would be a lot of duplication. ---Issa

Ok, maybe I'm slightly wrong on what content an article should contain. I branched the discussion in the next section "Page Template". --Mati


# Page Template
In order to give prospective contributors to the CPW a better view of what the CPW is trying to achieve, we could have a template page to review a cause area.

Here's what I have in mind so far. Please let me know if it's in line with your vision of the CPW.

Sections would include:

- a description of the cause area
- a review of the importance (scope, intensity, and probability), neglectedness, and tractability of the cause area (potentially evaluated for different metrics / moral values)
- synergy and interferences with other cause areas
- a summary of some effective interventions within that cause area
- a summary of how to pursue a career in such a domain
- a (possibly exhaustive) list of organizations working in that cause area (possibly evaluating them for interested donors)
- list of events (such as conferences), journals
- discussion groups
- external links: for more information on the topic
- see also: for adjacent topics

I think that's a good list. Have you seen the page [General questions for causes]()? If you haven't, that page might be what you are suggesting (you might want to add some of your ideas to that page). If you have, my next question would be to ask how that page is different from what you are suggesting. ---Issa
