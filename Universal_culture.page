Universal culture is the culture that emerges from the globalization.

Robert Wiblin argues that we should move toward a global culture.^[[Facebook post by Robert Wiblin on February 28th](https://www.facebook.com/robert.wiblin/posts/848784593755)]

> We should gradually move towards a world with only one culture for two main reasons:
> i) Inter-group conflict or cruelty is one of the great causes of human suffering, and a key threat to our collective future. We can reduce this a great deal by increasing cultural homogeneity - thereby making it as unimaginable for the US and China to go to war as it is for the US and Canada to go to war.
> ii) This way everyone can enjoy being part of the absolute best culture we can come up with, and nobody need be forced into retaining and suffering through the second or third best culture, or worse.
