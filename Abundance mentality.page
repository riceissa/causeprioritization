If we could encourage more people to have an abundance mentality (rather than a scarcity mentality - much of it coming from zero-sum thinking), I feel that much more can be done.

Some quotes from *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People#Abundance_mentality)*:

> Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality.
> They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one
> pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it
> would mean less for everybody else. The Scarcity Mentality is the
> zero-sum paradigm of life.
> 
> People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very difficult time sharing
> recognition and credit, power or profit—even with those who help in
> the production. They also have a very hard time being genuinely happy
> for the successes of other people—even, and sometimes especially,
> members of their own family or close friends and associates. It’s
> almost as if something is being taken from them when someone else
> receives special recognition or windfall gain or has remarkable
> success or achievement.
> 
> Although they might verbally express happiness for others’ success,
> inwardly they are eating their hearts out. Their sense of worth comes
> from being compared, and someone else’s success, to some degree, means
> their failure. Only so many people can be “A” students; only one
> person can be “number one.” To “win” simply means to “beat.”
>
> [...]
>
> One thing I have found particularly helpful to Win/Lose people in
> developing a Win/Win character is to associate with some model or
> mentor who really thinks Win/Win. When people are deeply scripted in
> Win/Lose or other philosophies and regularly associate with others who
> are likewise scripted, they don’t have much opportunity to see and
> experience the Win/Win philosophy in action.



It seems to IK that most people have an artificial scarcity mindset (much of it coming from the socialization effects of K-12 education itself).

The Internet makes it easier for people with abundance mindsets to share than ever before.
