If we could encourage more people to have an abundance mentality (rather than a scarcity mentality - much of it coming from zero-sum thinking), I feel that much more can be done.

Basic questions:

- Is getting more people to have an abundance mentality *in general* a good idea?
If it isn't, then is it still a good idea in specific contexts (e.g. at the workplace, in school, in dating, when dealing with friends and family)?
- What sorts of interventions are possible, and how tractable are they?
This cause fits under a general "getting society to be nicer/more moral" framework, so relevant results could be transferred here.
- See also [General questions for causes]().

Some quotes from *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People#Abundance_mentality)*:

> Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality.
> They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one
> pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it
> would mean less for everybody else. The Scarcity Mentality is the
> zero-sum paradigm of life.
> 
> People with a Scarcity Mentality have a very difficult time sharing
> recognition and credit, power or profit—even with those who help in
> the production. They also have a very hard time being genuinely happy
> for the successes of other people—even, and sometimes especially,
> members of their own family or close friends and associates. It’s
> almost as if something is being taken from them when someone else
> receives special recognition or windfall gain or has remarkable
> success or achievement.
> 
> Although they might verbally express happiness for others’ success,
> inwardly they are eating their hearts out. Their sense of worth comes
> from being compared, and someone else’s success, to some degree, means
> their failure. Only so many people can be “A” students; only one
> person can be “number one.” To “win” simply means to “beat.”

> One thing I have found particularly helpful to Win/Lose people in

> experience the Win/Win philosophy in action.



It seems to IK that most people have an artificial scarcity mindset (much of it coming from the socialization effects of K-12 education itself).

The Internet makes it easier for people with abundance mindsets to share than ever before. 

This question might get good answers later: [Is abundance mentality really a good mental framework?](https://www.quora.com/Is-abundance-mentality-really-a-good-mental-framework)

Also it would be interesting to explore abundance mindsets in dating and relationships (e.g. [compersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory#Compersion)).
