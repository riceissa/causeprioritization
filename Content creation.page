See [this page](http://riceissa.com/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge).
Essentially, making knowledge easily accessible seems to have lots of benefits.
Also look at question-and-answer sites (e.g. StackOverflow, by providing good programming answers, may be making programmers much more productive, which helps to produce more output, etc.).

Also look at things like [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/) and Gratipay.
