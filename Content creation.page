See [this page](http://riceissa.com/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge).
Essentially, making knowledge easily accessible seems to have lots of benefits.
Also look at question-and-answer sites (e.g. StackOverflow, by providing good programming answers, may be making programmers much more productive, which helps to produce more output, etc.).

Note that content creation is an odd cause (it is more of a "cause schema") because for each cause, there is the question of creating content for that cause.

Also look at things like [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/) and Gratipay.

Some examples:

# Importance

- One thing to consider is the historical argument that many ideas have greatly influenced the world (e.g. the scientific method, various religions), and that these wouldn't have spread without "content creation" (in a form that is different from today, mostly through books and real-life interaction instead of online).
In this sense the magnitude of the value of "content creation" seems quite large and the sign positive overall.
- One must also keep in mind that the importance of any particular topic of content creation can only be a fraction of the total importance of content creation in general.[^carl_ai]

[^carl_ai]: A similar reasoning has been given [by Carl Shulman](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i7p/how_does_miri_know_it_has_a_medium_probability_of/9i5b) on the ability of MIRI (specific group) to reduce AI risk (general cause):

    > For myself, I think the cause of AI risk reduction, in total and
    > over time, has a worthwhile small-to-medium probability of making
    > an astronomical difference on our civilization's future (and a
    > high probability that the future will be very powerfully shaped by
    > artificial intelligence in a way that can be affected by initial
    > conditions). But the impact of MIRI in particular has to be a far
    > smaller subset of the expected impact of the cause as a whole, in

    > probability that AI is not close enough for MIRI to be very
    > relevant, the probability that MIRI's approach turns out
    > irrelevant, uncertainty over the sign of effects due to
    > contributions to AI progress, future AI risk
    > efforts/replaceability, and various other drag factors.

# Tractability

The actual act of content creation is relatively low-key; see for instance [Robert Winslow](https://www.quora.com/What-do-effective-altruists-think-of-online-content-creation/answer/Robert-Winslow-1):

> [I]f you can only handle the stress of working so many hours a week, and
> you find content creation a relaxing pursuit, then you can improve the
> output of your leisure time by creating content.

Of course, more concentrated forms of content creation, like the GiveWell blog, take more effort, although the mere act of creating content still is very tractable.

It is more important to consider the topic one is investigating and hoping to create content for.
Thus tractability depends greatly on the specific type of content and it is hard to remark in general about how tractable content creation is.

# Neglectedness

Clearly this depends on the type of content that is created.
There do seem to be particular topics that are neglected; see for instance [User:Brian Tomasik/Pages to create or improve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Brian_Tomasik/Pages_to_create_or_improve) and [Open Research Questions \- Foundational Research Institute](http://foundational-research.org/open-research-questions/).

- One idea in need of exploration is that of "learning by doing".
In other words, content creators may claim that they can build expertise in a subject better than if they had merely read about a topic.
In other words, we can instantiate an argument like the following that Eliezer Yudkowsky makes [in a comment on LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i7p/how_does_miri_know_it_has_a_medium_probability_of/9iy4):

    > The life lesson I've learned is that by the time you really get

    > positive miracles, some negative miracles, your plans will have
    > changed, you'll have found that the parts which took the longest
