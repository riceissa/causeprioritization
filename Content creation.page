See [this page](http://riceissa.com/content-creation-the-organization-and-dissemination-of-knowledge).
Essentially, making knowledge easily accessible seems to have lots of benefits.
Also look at question-and-answer sites (e.g. StackOverflow, by providing good programming answers, may be making programmers much more productive, which helps to produce more output, etc.).

Also look at things like [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/) and Gratipay.

Some examples:

# Importance

# Tractability

# Neglectedness

Clearly this depends on the type of content that is created.
There do seem to be particular topics that are neglected; see for instance [User:Brian Tomasik/Pages to create or improve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Brian_Tomasik/Pages_to_create_or_improve) and [Open Research Questions \- Foundational Research Institute](http://foundational-research.org/open-research-questions/).

- One idea in need of exploration is that of "learning by doing".
In other words, content creators may claim that they can build expertise in a subject better than if they had merely read about a topic.
In other words, we can instantiate an argument like the following that Eliezer Yudkowsky makes [in a comment on LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i7p/how_does_miri_know_it_has_a_medium_probability_of/9iy4):

    > The life lesson I've learned is that by the time you really get
    > anywhere, *if* you get anywhere, you'll have encountered some
    > positive miracles, some negative miracles, your plans will have
    > changed, you'll have found that the parts which took the longest
    > weren't what you thought they would be, and that other things
    > proved to be much easier than expected. Your successes won't come
    > through foreseen avenues, and neither will your failures. But
    > running through it all will be the fundamental realization that
    > everything you accomplished, and all the unforeseen opportunities
    > you took advantage of, were things that you would never have
    > received if you hadn't attacked the hardest part of the problem
    > that you knew about straight-on, without
    > distraction.

- The trade-off of more pageviews versus "better content", e.g. A Plus versus the GiveWell blog.
