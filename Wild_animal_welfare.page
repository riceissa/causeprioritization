# Tractability

On March 15th 2019, the Wild Animal Initiative mentions that:^[[Wild Animal Initiative Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/wildanimalinitiative/posts/2400656953487493)]

> If we were to be asked today about the highest priority welfare biology projects, we are, admittedly, fairly uncertain; no comprehensive effort to identify these projects has occurred. This gap in our knowledge base captures the essential direction of Wild Animal Initiative’s work — a major strategic shift toward a twofold goal: first, identifying and prioritizing early welfare biology projects, and second, completing the heavy lifting necessary to lower the costs of early welfare biology.

However, given that little research has been done on wild animal suffering prioritization, it's likely that a lot of progress can be made on that question.

# Neglectedness

Few organizations work in that cause area.

# Interventions

# Organizations

Direct focus:

- [Wild-Animal Suffering Research](https://was-research.org/)
- [The Neuroethics Foundation](www.neuroethics.com)

One of the focus:

- [Sentience Institute](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/)
- [Animal Ethics](http://www.animal-ethics.org/)
- [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/) (ie. they do prioritization research for animal welfare)

There are also organizations that work on reducing [risks of astronomical suffering]() that also does research relevant to wild animal suffering, notably the [Foundational Research Institute](https://foundational-research.org/).

Preventing human extinctions might also be a priority for reducing wild animal suffering as, without humans, wild animal suffering is likely to continue for another 2 billion years (so see also organizations working to reduce [existential risks]()).
