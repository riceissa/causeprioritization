# Tractability

On March 15th 2019, the Wild Animal Initiative mentions that:^[[Wild Animal Initiative Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/wildanimalinitiative/posts/2400656953487493)]

> If we were to be asked today about the highest priority welfare biology projects, we are, admittedly, fairly uncertain; no comprehensive effort to identify these projects has occurred. This gap in our knowledge base captures the essential direction of Wild Animal Initiative’s work — a major strategic shift toward a twofold goal: first, identifying and prioritizing early welfare biology projects, and second, completing the heavy lifting necessary to lower the costs of early welfare biology.

However, given that little research has been done on wild animal suffering prioritization, it's likely that a lot of progress can be made on that question.
