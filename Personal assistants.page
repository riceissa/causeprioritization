Personal assistants can make 10x programmers even more productive. 

IK's impression is that some 10x programmers still have scarcity mindsets (so they don't get as many personal assistants as they could get).

Also, it's possible that the "prestige" of personal assistants may not be sufficiently high enough to attract the best possible people to such a role, even though smarter personal assistants could even be more effective.
