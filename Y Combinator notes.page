- [Announcement](http://old.ycombinator.com/watsi.html) of funding [Watsi](http://watsi.org/).

    > After we met the founders of Watsi, we realized they'd be the perfect one to start with.
    >
    >  We owe Hacker News thanks for introducing us to Watsi. When Watsi launched, they posted about themselves on HN. They were a hit with HN users and raised a significant amount of money.

    The rest of the post is just self-contratulatory.

- From [YC Will Now Fund Nonprofits Too](http://www.ycombinator.com/nonprofits/):

    > We don’t know how many nonprofits we’ll fund, or what type of ideas we’ll like. We like Watsi a lot, because they help people who really need help, and do it in an efficient and transparent way. But fundamentally this is an experiment, just like YC itself was at first. So we don’t want to tell people too precisely what we’re looking for, because we’re not sure yet what we’re looking for.
