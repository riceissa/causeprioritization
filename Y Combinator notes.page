# How does Y Combinator choose what it funds?

- [Announcement](http://old.ycombinator.com/watsi.html) of funding [Watsi](http://watsi.org/).

    > After we met the founders of Watsi, we realized they'd be the perfect one to start with.
    >
    >  We owe Hacker News thanks for introducing us to Watsi. When Watsi launched, they posted about themselves on HN. They were a hit with HN users and raised a significant amount of money.

    The rest of the post is just self-contratulatory.

- Their main page that is most like cause prioritization, [Requests for Startups](http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/).  But it's important to keep in mind that they say:

    > You shouldn’t start a company just because it’s on this list. It’s
    > mostly here to help stimulate you to think about ideas.
    >
    > We don’t expect responses to RFSes will ever be more than a
    > fraction of the applications we accept. We wouldn’t want them to
    > be. Most good ideas should be ones that surprise us, not ones
    > we’re waiting for.
    >
    > [...]
    >
    > [T]he great majority of the startups we fund will continue to be the sort of Internet and mobile companies we’ve funded in the past

    In any case, looking at the *actual projects they do fund* is probably a more accurate metric for what they actually believe than what they say they want to fund.

- From [YC Will Now Fund Nonprofits Too](http://www.ycombinator.com/nonprofits/):

    > We don’t know how many nonprofits we’ll fund, or what type of ideas we’ll like. We like Watsi a lot, because they help people who really need help, and do it in an efficient and transparent way. But fundamentally this is an experiment, just like YC itself was at first. So we don’t want to tell people too precisely what we’re looking for, because we’re not sure yet what we’re looking for.

    > So why go to YC? Mirza admits that the trio was hesitant at first about applying. “We did wonder if it was suitable given that so many startups here are at a much earlier stage,” she said. “But based on the traction that we’d seen other YC startups get, and the success stories we heard, we decided that we could build a good company without YC, but we could build a great enterprise with it.”

    Essentially a non-profit that helps other non-profits. The [Giveffect website](https://www.giveffect.com/) lists more "traditional" charities.

- From its [announcement of Bayes Impact](http://blog.ycombinator.com/harnessing-big-data-for-social-good-nonprofit-bayes-impact-yc-s14-launches) (July 2014):

    > We're excited to welcome [Bayes
    > Impact](http://www.bayesimpact.org/) to Y Combinator. Bayes Impact
    > is a nonprofit that deploys teams of data scientists to create
    > data-driven solutions for challenging social problems. The
    > organization runs full-time fellowship programs that bring
    > together domain experts and data scientists from top technology
    > companies and academic institutions.

    From the [TechCrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/15/harnessing-big-data-for-social-good-yc-backed-nonprofit-bayes-impact-launches/):

    > “I was volunteering at homeless shelters for a little while,” says Duan. “I was shocked by the difference between this manual labor, this one-to-one exchange, and the idea that improving the accuracy of a [programming] model by 1% can affect millions of users and bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.”
    >
    > The ah-ha moment was determining that the same science can be leveraged for social good. “I had been working with the City of New York implementing civic solutions and recognized that the chasm between the technology that industry and tech companies are using and what’s available to civic organizations is huge,” says Jiang.

# Reasons to/not to look into Y Combinator

- It seems unclear whether this sort of investigation is very tractable. As GiveWell has often noted, organizations don't do a lot of explicit prioritization work, and even if they do, they don't release a lot of their actual work/thought process.

- More externally successful than any explicit "effective altruist" group has been. See e.g. [Paul Graham on US immigration policy and high-tech programmers](http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/):

    > I’m a great fan of [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com),
    > essayist, entrepreneur, and co-founder of startup accelerator [Y
    > Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com) (along with his wife
    > Jessica Livingston, whom I also admire greatly). Through Y
    > Combinator, Graham has changed the startup and tech company

    > [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com),
    > [Scribd](http://www.scribd.com), [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com),
    > and [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com)). Graham also started [Hacker

- GiveWell also does similar sort of work, e.g. looking into how big philanthropists go about grantmaking. See e.g. its most recent [Key questions about philanthropy, part 2: choosing focus areas and hiring program staff](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/07/09/key-questions-about-philanthropy-part-2-choosing-focus-areas-and-hiring-program-staff/).

- However, possibly some epistemic problems.

- Okay, so far: the YC website isn't very good at explaining their reasoning *at all*, and their blog just outsources announcements to TechCrunch anyway. And a lot ($n=2$) of the non-profits they fund just have those "app generation" websites that don't really explain *anything*.
