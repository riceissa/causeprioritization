# How does Y Combinator choose what it funds?

- [Announcement](http://old.ycombinator.com/watsi.html) of funding [Watsi](http://watsi.org/).

    > After we met the founders of Watsi, we realized they'd be the perfect one to start with.
    >
    >  We owe Hacker News thanks for introducing us to Watsi. When Watsi launched, they posted about themselves on HN. They were a hit with HN users and raised a significant amount of money.

    The rest of the post is just self-contratulatory.

- Their main page that is most like cause prioritization, [Requests for Startups](http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/).

- From [YC Will Now Fund Nonprofits Too](http://www.ycombinator.com/nonprofits/):

    > We don’t know how many nonprofits we’ll fund, or what type of ideas we’ll like. We like Watsi a lot, because they help people who really need help, and do it in an efficient and transparent way. But fundamentally this is an experiment, just like YC itself was at first. So we don’t want to tell people too precisely what we’re looking for, because we’re not sure yet what we’re looking for.

    > So why go to YC? Mirza admits that the trio was hesitant at first about applying. “We did wonder if it was suitable given that so many startups here are at a much earlier stage,” she said. “But based on the traction that we’d seen other YC startups get, and the success stories we heard, we decided that we could build a good company without YC, but we could build a great enterprise with it.”

# Reasons to/not to look into Y Combinator

- It seems unclear whether this sort of investigation is very tractable. As GiveWell has often noted, organizations don't do a lot of explicit prioritization work, and even if they do, they don't release a lot of their actual work/thought process.

- More externally successful than any explicit "effective altruist" group has been.

- GiveWell also does similar sort of work, e.g. looking into how big philanthropists go about grantmaking. See e.g. its most recent [Key questions about philanthropy, part 2: choosing focus areas and hiring program staff](http://blog.givewell.org/2015/07/09/key-questions-about-philanthropy-part-2-choosing-focus-areas-and-hiring-program-staff/).

- However, possibly some epistemic problems. See e.g. [Paul Graham on US immigration policy and high-tech programmers](http://openborders.info/blog/paul-graham-us-immigration-policy-high-tech-programmers/):
