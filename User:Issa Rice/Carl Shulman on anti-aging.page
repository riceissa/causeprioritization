Collection of things Carl Shulman has said on anti-aging. **Note**: a
lot of these are comments on various websites, so it's impossible to
verify the identity of commenters.

- [Comment on Overcoming
  Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/serious-unconve.html#comment-518273471),
  mentioning SENS (comment talks about more):

    > I do think that society under-invests in aging research relative
    > to other medical research, and that SENS in fact offers a rather
    > good expected value among the available medical research options,
    > but this argument leads me to rate it less favorably than I
    > otherwise would.

- [Another comment](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/serious-unconve.html#comment-518273635):

    > [I]t's plausible that political lobbying is the most effective
    > place to expend funds at this time.

  he calls anti-aging a "very valuable research [topic]" along with
  research on energy.  However he also says "strong AI could be used to
  quickly achieve the rest".
