**Better explanations** or **improving explanations** is a cause area working to explain ideas to people better.

Some reasons to think this is useful:

- Better explanations allow people to learn more quickly, allowing them to spend more time doing things or learning other things
- Better explanations mean people with less talent in an area can learn things. One way to think about this is that 100 years before an idea is discovered, no human is bright enough to understand the "explanation"; by the time the idea is discovered, only the brightest humans can understand the "explanation"; as the idea is published, more and more people can learn about the idea; when good expositions are produced, people with non-standard backgrounds or cognitive styles, or less talent can learn the idea.

In some cases, there may already exist good explanations, but these just aren't widely known. In that sense, resources like Luke Muehlhauser's ["The Best Textbooks on Every Subject"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gu/the_best_textbooks_on_every_subject/) that try to find good existing expositions can be considered part of this cause area.
