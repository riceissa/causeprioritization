# Welcome to the Cause Prioritization Wiki!

This wiki aims to be a useful resource for information on [cause prioritization]().
Look at the [categories](http://causeprioritization.org/_categories) for how this wiki is organized, or the list below for some of the causes being explored.
At the moment the goal is to collect resources related to cause prioritization on each of the causes (in particular, the [importance, tractability, and neglectedness]() of the causes) and to produce many [shallow investigations](Shallow_investigation) on these causes.
See the [goals of the wiki]() and the [FAQ]() for more information.

This wiki is [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/riceissa/causeprioritization), where you can get a full copy of it (including all of the revision history). Additionally, auxiliary files are available at a [separate Git repository](https://github.com/riceissa/cause-prioritization-wiki-auxiliary-files).

Contact [Issa Rice](http://issarice.com/contact) for questions.

**Note**: All principal causes (i.e. like those listed above) will have the category "[Cause_areas](http://causeprioritization.org/_category/Cause_areas)".
(This is so that in the future, if the number of principal causes increases, these can all be found in one place, even if the list above is not updated.
See also the discussion [here](http://causeprioritization.org/@Front%20Page#list-all-causes-on-front-page).)
