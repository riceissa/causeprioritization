The **Drake equation** was first [used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation).
The idea is to calculate the number of possible planets (which is itself calculated) and to keep taking fractions of that number according to various parameters.
Vipul Naik of *Open Borders: The Case* says in [his post about the Drake equation as applied to open borders](http://openborders.info/blog/open-borders-advocacy-a-drake-equation/):

The general "cause prioritization Drake equation" would be to estimate the gains from a cause (roughly the "importance") and to keep taking fractions of those gains according to uncertainties.
