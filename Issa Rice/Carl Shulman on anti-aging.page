Collection of things Carl Shulman has said on anti-aging. **Note**: a
lot of these are comments on various websites, so it's impossible to
verify the identity of commenters.

- [Comment on Overcoming
  Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/serious-unconve.html#comment-518273471),
  mentioning SENS (comment talks about more):

    > I do think that society under-invests in aging research relative
    > to other medical research, and that SENS in fact offers a rather
    > good expected value among the available medical research options,
    > but this argument leads me to rate it less favorably than I
    > otherwise would.

- [Another comment](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/serious-unconve.html#comment-518273635):

    > [I]t's plausible that political lobbying is the most effective
    > place to expend funds at this time.

    > However, it may be that the most effective way to influence
    > funding is by demonstrating the potential of promising new
    > approaches via selection of particular good unconventional
    > projects with high expected value. Or one might invest in a
    > for-profit startup to try to get at least one anti-aging therapy
    > in broad use, enhancing public support and interest.
    > Unfortunately, such efforts require greater than average ability
    > to evaluate scientific approaches and researchers (not just
    > biologically, but also from economic and probabilistic
    > viewpoints). The advantage of the M-Prize is that it evades the
    > need for such evaluative capacity (or the ability to identify such
    > capacity in others), while promoting good novel approaches and
    > drawing media attention to aging research.
