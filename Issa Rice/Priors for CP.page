|-
| Anti-aging
| Biological research
| Technological/scientific, one-off
| Fairly controversial, though most objections seem to have strong counterpoints.  In particular, there seems to be a clear epistemic triad of (life is good so more life is better [young kids?]; it could lead to lots of problems like overpopulation and boredom and stagnation [educated adults?]; all those objectsions are silly, life is still good [people on LW, Bryan Caplan])
| I forget; but it's something like a trillion a year just in the US alone?
| Seems like an important cause, but does it do better than just natalism?
| Hard to say.  Even if we ignore people like de Grey, there still seems to a lot of people who seriously think "curing aging" is possible.
| There seems to be at least a few hundred researchers here, but probably a lot more could be done if we're serious about this.
| It might be hard to avoid bias toward this cause because of its inherent "selfishness".
| There seems to be significant disagreement among people working in this cause (de Grey vs Kaeberlein, for instance).
| N/A
| Probably not very much?  It doesn't seem to do much better than pure natalism alone.  I mean, maybe not having to train programmers or scientists each generation will lead to faster development, for example.  But it's not like existential risk in this regard, I think.
| As noted above, it might lead to faster development in technology and science.
| If the person-affecting view is true, then since making new people isn't of any use, it turns out that keeping the currently-existing people for alive as long as possible is the way to go.
|-
| Open borders
| Politics, policy
| Advocacy
| Pretty controversial in the mainstream.  Though I'm not sure there is much disagreement among the knowledgeable about whether open borders is a good idea.  Those on LW seem particularly in favor of it, for example.  In particular, the fact that open borders would ''immensely'' help those in developing countries seems undeniable.
| See Alexander Berger's calculations.  Something like a one-off boost in the trillions. And then probably less after that.
| Really important, though it's hard to get myself to care too much about it, as John Lee notes in his post.
| It's a policy thing, so really depends.  Even OB seems to think this is mostly theoretical at this point?
| People definitely do talk about it, but not in the way Bryan Caplan or OB talks about it.
| I have to keep in mind that Vipul runs OB.
| I'm not too sure about this
| Lobbying, advocacy, writing blog posts???
| Helping the currently-disadvantaged could lead to huge flow-through effects, which can speed up development, changing the long-term trajectory that way.  There might also be a case for something like, say, open borders leads to more people being productive and working on the right problems, so it reduces existential risk.  It probably also leads to a more moral society.
| As noted, it probably speeds up development.
| Remarkably, open borders doesn't seem to require any hard ethical stances. I mean, as long as you're cosmpolitan, egalitarian, etc., then it's hard to deny OB as a cause.
|-
| Animal welfare
| Lifestyle/general ethics
| Advocacy
| Yeah it's kind of controversial in a sense.  But most people are either passionate or apathetic.
| N/A
| Depends ''a lot'' on what moral value you assign to animals.  I'd say it's important, but not as important as, say, open borders.  There also aren't the flow-through effects you'd see from open borders.  Also there seems to be a clear ordering of which animals to focus on.
| Personally fairly tractable (having become vegetarian) but advocacy seems difficult, especially if you want people to actually stay vegetarian/vegan.
| There actually seems to be many groups (though they may oppose each other).
| I'm personally essentially vegetarian.  It's not clear to me that the main benefit of getting people to not eat meat is the reduction of suffering; it may be, for instance, in the form of longevity or environmental benefits (not using water), and also sustainability (you can feed more people).
| Seems divergent.
| Advocacy, Overton window stuff, influencing peers.
| Changing people's diet might affect trajectory, but it isn't from anything to do with animal welfare.
| Probably none?
| That animals have great moral value, basically.
