title: Allocation of talent

**Allocation of talent** is the matching of labor or skill with output or value,
so that people are working on what they individually can do most to produce
things of value.  In the context of a career, allocation of talent becomes the
problem of [Job selection](). Currently a lot of talent or skill seems to be
misallocated, in the sense that people are working on things that may not produce
a lot of value or that they're not good at.

In terms of cause prioritization, some questions to ask are:

- How badly is talent misallocated?
- Who is working on this problem? (What are some names under which this same idea
  is known?)

    > There too is an incredible amount of material to cover, by some really smart people (what did geeks do before science and modernity? well, for the most part, they seem to have done theology; consider how much time and effort Isaac Newton reportedly [spent on alchemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac%20Newton%27s%20occult%20studies%23Alchemical%20research "Wikipedia: Isaac Newton's occult studies#Alchemical research") and [his own Biblical studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac%20Newton%27s%20religious%20views "Wikipedia: Isaac Newton's religious views"), or the sheer brainpower that mustâ€™ve been spent over the centuries in rabbinical studies).
