Here are some quotes from Pincus and Pettit[^pincus] that underscore the importance of depression as a cause.

[^pincus]: Harold Alan Pincus and Amy R. Pettit.
*The Societal Costs of Chronic Major Depression*.
2001.

> The annual cost of depression in the United States has been
> estimated at $43.7 billion to $52.9 billion, including costs due to
> health care, suicide, and workplace losses. The impact of
> depression on the overall health care system is enormous, including
> $12.4 billion in direct medical, psychiatric, and pharmaceutical
> costs. The overall medical costs of the average person with
> depression are approximately twice as high as those of the average
> person without depression. On average, depressed patients utilize
> health care services 3 times more frequently and visit the
> emergency room 7 times more often.
>
> Workplace costs related to absenteeism and reduced productivity have
> been estimated at $23.8 billion. In a recent survey, approximately 80%
> of employers reported de- pression as a problem in their work
> settings, with 40% identifying the problem as moderate or large.
> Depressed employees incur more disability days than patients with
> chronic back pain, heart disease, other mental disorders,
> hypertension, or diabetes. The tremendous negative impact of
> depression suggests that proper diagnosis and effective treatment are
> critically needed.

(from page 6)

Note that suicide alone "results in an estimated $12.4 billion in lost productivity and wages per year" (page 6).

Here are some quotes from Donohue and Pincus[^donohue]:

- From the abstract (page 7--8):

    > We examined the impact of depression on two of the primary drivers
    > of the societal burden of depression: healthcare utilisation and
    > worker productivity.  Depression leads to higher healthcare
    > utilisation and spending, most of which is not the result of
    > depression treatment costs. Depression is also a leading cause of
    > absenteeism and reduced productivity at work. It is clear that the
    > economic burden of depression is substantial; however, critical
    > gaps in the literature remain and need to be addressed. For
    > instance, we do not know the economic burden of untreated and/or
    > inappropriately treated versus appropriately treated depression.

- "Total economic costs of depression totalled $US83.1 billion in 2000, up from $US77.4 billion in 1990." (page 12)
