- [Differential Intellectual Progress as a Positive\-Sum Project \- Foundational Research Institute](http://foundational-research.org/publications/differential-intellectual-progress-as-a-positive-sum-project/) (takes a broader approach than just AI risk)
- [Differential intellectual progress](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Differential_intellectual_progress) on LW wiki (focuses on AI risk)
- <http://www.existential-risk.org/figure5.png>? (see [this comment](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/12p) for more info; also find where Bostrom talks about this)
- [On Progress and Prosperity](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/) by Paul Christiano.
In [a comment](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/12c) Helen Toner identifies the following areas in terms of differential progress:

    > -   The [Good Judgement Project](http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/04/02/297839429/-so-you-think-youre-smarter-than-a-cia-agent)
    > -   Political lobbying to promote regulation of biotech & nanotech research, a la CEA's/FHI's [Global Priorities Project](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/)
    > -   AI safety research
    > -   Animal rights activism (where the emphasis is on values shift/[expanding circles](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9434.html))

- In general the importance of focusing on the social sciences over the hard sciences is a point raised by both Brian Tomasik and [Paul Christiano](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/149)

Differential intellectual progress is also one way to look at causes; i.e. one can ask the question of "Does this cause increase or decrease risk?"
