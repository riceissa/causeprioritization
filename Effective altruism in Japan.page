This fits under [Promoting effective altruism]().

# Upshot

Japan, despite being quite populous, has *absolutely no community around effective altruism*.
Peter Singer's book/TED talk seem to have been translated into the language, but that is the extent to which EA is known.
Taking into account Japan's relative prosperity, it may be useful to build a community around EA in Japan.

A partial (and very rough) translation of the EA Wikipedia article is [available here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%84%E5%88%A9%E4%BB%96%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9).
