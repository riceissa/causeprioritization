Let's analyze the benefits/costs of various violent actions! Or "active" measures. For example, committing terrorism, defacing property, etc. in order to push a cause. 

Are these violent actions ever viable? etc. 

I've never seen analysis of violent causes within CP, so idk, maybe it should be looked into.
