This page explores changes in people's mentality as a result of [Life extension]().

For instance, would people adopt more or less of an [Abundance mentality]() as a result of radical life extension?
If life extension increases population, for example, it could lead to greater competition of finite resources.
On the other hand, if people know that they have many more years of life left than they previously thought, they might be more willing to "relax", knowing that there will be a chance for them to do/experience something at some point in the future instead of trying to "cram" everything in around 80 years.

Other questions to ask are:

- Will society become "nicer" or "more moral" naturally as a consequence of life extension?
