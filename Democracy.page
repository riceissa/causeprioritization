# Volunteering

Non-denominational volunteering opportunities in politics.

## Tracking political promises

[Polimeter](https://www.polimeter.org/) is a platform that allows to track how well politicians keep their promises. This likely increases the incentive for politicians to be honest. This is useful because if citizens don't know how their vote will translate in policies, it's harder for them to vote meaningfully. Plus, citizens are likely to prefer more honest politicians all else equal. The platform allows to create new trackers as well as contributing to existing ones.

Other existing trackers: [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/)

## Voting reform

[The Center for Election Science](https://electology.org/) is working to implement an approval voting mechanism in more jurisdictions in the US. They work with volunteers with various expertise; see: [https://www.electionscience.org/take-action/volunteer/](https://www.electionscience.org/take-action/volunteer/).


## National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

[National Popular Vote](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/) is promoting the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) which aims to make the electoral vote reflect the popular vote. They are looking for volunteers; see [https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/volunteer](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/volunteer).
