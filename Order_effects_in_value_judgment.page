see also ["Order Effects in Moral Judgment"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/23b4/9e2f491f9e460828797ba115dac89d1a1753.pdf).

wei dai also talks about this in his LW comments (or maybe a post?)

One of the "meta-ethical alternatives" Wei Dai gives is:[^metaethical]

> None of the above facts exist, and reflecting on what one wants turns out to be a divergent process (e.g., it's highly sensitive to initial conditions, like whether or not you drank a cup of coffee before you started, or to the order in which you happen to encounter philosophical arguments). There are still facts about rationality, so at least agents that are already rational can call their utility functions (or the equivalent of utility functions in whatever decision theory ends up being the right one) their real values.

And:[^ref_eq]

> I often wonder and ask others what non-trivial properties we can state about moral reasoning (i.e., besides that theoretically it must be some sort of an algorithm). One thing that I don't think we know yet is that for any given human, their moral judgments/intuitions are guaranteed to converge to some stable and coherent set as time goes to infinity. It may well be the case that there are multiple eventual equilibria that depend on the order in which one considers arguments, or none if for example their conclusions keep wandering chaotically among several basins of attraction as they review previously considered arguments. So I think the singular term "reflective equilibrium" is currently unjustified when talking about someone's eventual conclusions, and we should instead use "the possibly null set of eventual reflective equilibria". (Unless someone can come up with a pithier term that has similar connotations and denotations.)
