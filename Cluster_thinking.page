**Cluster thinking** is a kind of thinking where one separates various perspectives, weighs each, then comes to a final conclusion.
It contrasts with [sequence thinking]().
It was first outlined by Holden Karnofsky in his GiveWell blog post "[Sequence Thinking vs. Cluster Thinking](http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/)".

Here, "perspectives" or "models" means different ways of thinking about the problem:

> [Besides an expected value calculation, w]e also have a variety of other perspectives for evaluating the action: does this action deviate greatly from "normality?" Does it deviate from what expert opinion would suggest? Does this action pattern-match (even superficially) to other successful actions or to other failed actions?[^models]
