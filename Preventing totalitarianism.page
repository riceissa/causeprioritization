Bryan Caplan has a chapter on totalitarian rule in [Global Catastrophic
Risks].

[Global Catastrophic Risks]: http://www.amazon.com/Global-Catastrophic-Risks-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199606501/

Caplan notes that totalitarianism could amplify other risks (besides the
raw amount of suffering it causes) since
regimes fail to "anticipate and counteract events that even their
leaders saw as catastrophic" due to "concentration of power, which
allowed leaders' idiosyncrasies to decide the fates of millions" and
also fear of calling out leaders on their mistakes. (However Caplan also
notes the efficiency of totalitarianism in achieving certain goals.)

Bryan Caplan, noting how totalitarian regimes to date have not lasted
very long, writes:

> If the short lifespan of totalitarianism is inherent, it probably does
> not count as a 'global catastrophic risk' at all. On the other hand,
> if the rapid demise of totalitarianism was a lucky accident, if future
> totalitarians could learn from history to indefinitely prolong their
> rule, then totalitarianism is one of the most important global
> catastrophic risks to stop before it starts.

Caplan also notes that an obsession to solve or mitigate other global
catastrophic risks could lead to totalitarianism (p514):

> one particularly scary scenario for the future is that overblown
> doomsday worries become the rationale for world government, paving the
> way for an unanticipated global catastrophe: totalitarianism.  Those
> who call for the countries of the world to unite against threats to
> humanity should consider the possibility that unification itself is
> the greater threat.
