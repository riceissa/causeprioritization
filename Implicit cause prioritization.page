A lot of cause prioritization happens implicitly:

- By working in one cause area rather than another, people are implicitly prioritizing among causes.
- As the investigation of a cause area becomes more specialized, it might be difficult to tell apart from non-cause prioritization work in the area. For example, investigation of AI safety as a cause area may eventually begin to look like a synthesis of existing ideas or an examination of AI timelines (which is relevant outside of a cause prioritization framework). Even if a researcher has cause prioritization at the back of their mind, they might not explicitly say they are doing prioritization work.
