A lot of cause prioritization happens implicitly:

- By working in one cause area rather than another, people are implicitly prioritizing among causes.
- As the investigation of a cause area becomes more specialized, it might be difficult to tell apart from non-cause prioritization work in the area. For example, investigation of AI safety as a cause area may eventually begin to look like a synthesis of existing ideas or an examination of AI timelines (which is relevant outside of a cause prioritization framework). Even if a researcher has cause prioritization at the back of their mind, they might not explicitly say they are doing prioritization work.[^note]

[^note]: Speaking for myself (Issa), I haven't been very good about maintaining this wiki over the past few years (2016--2017). But it isn't that I haven't been working on cause prioritization. Rather, I've been exploring fields in cause-specific sites like [AI Watch](https://aiwatch.issarice.com/), [Devec](https://devec.subwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Computing Data Project](https://github.com/riceissa/computing-data-project), and [various timelines](https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?limit=50&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Issa&namespace=&tagfilter=&newOnly=1). And also in general learning to do research better and have more accurate beliefs about the world. I hope to *at some point soon* tie all this work back into an explicit cause prioritization.
