Tools like [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) could help speed up the research process.
In addition, we might want things like an improved version of LaTeX for typesetting and document preparation.

Personal assistants for researchers could be another thing. The reason for this is explained in a post by Andrew Critch, entitled "[Seeking a paid personal assistant to create more x-risk research hours](http://acritch.com/pa/)":

> Conservatively, I think for every hour of mine you save, I’ll end up
> doing about 30 minutes of additional AI x-risk research.  Sometimes,
> maybe as much as 2 or 3 hours of extra research will get done for
> every hour you work, because you’ll have turned a block of interrupted
> time for me into a block of uninterrupted time, which is much better
> for research.

Another idea from [here](https://quip.com/DaigAKEyGulg): "Make it far easier for researchers to conduct causal studies (likely participant recruitment)".

There is a similar potential cause for each profession, and trying to make that profession's tasks run more smoothly.
In the case of programmers, newer tools could be written to make programming faster, more reliable, etc. (e.g. people cite functional programming languages like Haskell for being a better way to program (there are loads of Quora answers like this)).
(Although in the case of programming, programmers can implement these tools themselves, whereas in the case of a general profession, the professionals may not be able to implement the tools.)
